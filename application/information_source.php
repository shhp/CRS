From a design perspective, our job is to maximize the value of every visitor, whether they love the content or hate it. The role of a UX designer is not always to make everyone feel all warm and fuzzy inside. A rich Web experience could include the emotion of happiness, humor, discontent, sadness, anger or enlightenment.

These developments aren��t related to the lack of cross-browser standards support or technical downsides of the tools we are using. No, they have a different nature. They have emerged within our design community �� a community which is now so fertile and diverse that it is becoming increasingly difficult to ensure its professional maturity.","url" => "","source" => "www.smashingmagazine.com"),

So the question is, whether you should put that questionnaire up on your website or only send it to prospective clients once they��ve contacted you. There are a couple of reasons you may want to make it available online, but the obvious one is that clients are often eager to get started with their projects; providing the questionnaire online eliminates a step in the pre-contract part of the process.

Similarly, 56% of Bank of America's (BAC) second quarter pre-tax profit, 27% of JPMorgan's (JPM) second quarter net income, and 10% of JPMorgan's most recent quarterly net income all came from loan loss reserve reductions. As I noted when JPMorgan reported, the $900 million reduction in loan loss reserves for the third quarter looks especially ridiculous considering non-performing loans actually rose during the period. There are some who argue that this is nothing to worry about. After all, the loan loss reserve component of earnings is clearly spelled out in the \"significant items\" list of the firms' press releases so there is no attempt to hide anything and furthermore, it is quite reasonable for these firms to be reducing the amount set aside for bad loans as the housing market is improving.

Luxury car makers are starting their end-of-year discounts earlier as they fight to win the sales war of 2012 in the U.S. This is according to the president of Ford (F), Mark Fields, who is busy rebuilding the brand. For example, Bayerische Motoren Werke is offering customers who are leasing their cars an opportunity to buy new models of their cars while being able to skip payment on the cars that they currently own. This move might well be a way to catch up with Daimler, which produces Mercedes-Benz, a brand which trailed BMW sales in 2011.

				array("title" => "Which Is Better - Physical Gold Or Gold ETFs?","description" => "Years of reading and thinking about this issue and actually investing in both shiny gold bullion and paper/digital gold has given me the following perspective: If you are a long term (read 10+ years) investor looking for a secure hedge against market volatility, buying physical gold beats buying gold ETFs overall. Some considerations in buying physical gold are management fees in buying ETFs versus storing costs with physical gold, coin or bullion. If you buy an ETF like SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), you lose about .40% of the value of your investment every year in management fees. If you buy physical gold, there are three principle associated costs - storage, insurance, and transportation. Insurance is dependent on the volume of gold you own; however, both storage and transportation costs are less dependent on minor changes in volume. On the other hand, ETF management fee is totally dependent on volume/value. From an optimization point of view, if you are buying gold long term, in large volumes, and you plan to keep on adding to that volume in good quantities, both storage and transportation costs will go down on a per unit basis. As for insurance, many people will consider paying a few dollars today worth more than nothing when the next MF Global crisis occurs.","url" => "","source" => "seekingalpha.com")

But the long-term outlook for this year appears to be much improved and ski resorts are gearing up for what promises to be a much better season. In fact, the forecasts are so good that Mammoth Mountain, located in California's Sierra Nevada, is actually guaranteeing snow for opening day. Skiers who book a stay with Mammoth between now and November 8, the projected opening day, are guaranteed a base depth of at least 10 inches of snow when they hit the slopes. If the base is less than 10 inches, those guests can elect to keep their original registration and receive a $100 gift card or they can reschedule their stay without any kind of fees or penalties. But the resort is extending its snow guarantee well beyond opening day. The guarantee actually stretches into February with increasing base depths to correspond with the advancing dates. So while Mammoth promises 10 inches of snow in early November, that number actually rises to 28 inches by mid-December, 50 inches by mid-January and 70 inches by mid-February.","url" => "","source" => "www.gadling.com"),

On an annual basis, only about 20,000 people pass through its gates, despite the fact that it contains some of the most breathtaking backcountry in all of North America. There is a movement afoot to expand the park's borders, however, and if successful, advocates of the plan believe that it could attract many more travelers to the region. A group of conservationists, led by former U.S. Senator Dan Evans and mountaineer Jim Wickwire, have proposed an expansion to the North Cascades National Park that would add an additional 237,000 acres to its already impressive 500,000+. They also propose spending $23 million over five years to add or upgrade park amenities - something that is a bit of a tough sell with Congress these days. Proponents of the plan feel that the addition of the extra land would move park boundaries closer to main access roads, giving it a higher profile with travelers passing through the region.

The entire expedition is expected to last several months. Hansen began his journey on Mount Mismi, a snow-capped peak located in a remote section of the Peruvian Andes. The 18,363-foot (5597-meter) mountain has been identified as the most distant source of the Amazon with the Rio Apurimac, one of the prime tributaries for the river, beginning on its slopes. As it rushes down the mountain, the water picks up speed and power, creating dangerous Class V and VI+ rapids. West will need to successfully navigate those treacherous waters in the early days of the expedition. Reading the early updates on Hansen's Amazon Express website, it seems that low water flow at the headwaters have made it tough going over the first few days.

Regular flights service Kirkwall airport from Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Glasgow, and Inverness. There's also a long ferry from Aberdeen if you want to bring a car along. The ferry is no cheaper than the flight and takes several hours from Aberdeen as opposed to just one, so if you aren't bringing a car, it's probably best to go by air. Getting around. This can be a bit tricky. There's a public bus service but it's a bit limited and isn't timed with the ferry service. The ferries are better. They serve all the inhabited islands and are reasonably priced. Most are car ferries so you can bring your vehicle along.

The country's Ministry of Home Affairs announced recently that travelers visiting the Himalayan country will be required to hire support staff of either a porter or a guide. The policy shift won't affect groups of hikers, however, as they were already required to travel with a government approved trekking agency. This move comes in the wake of the brutal murder of a Belgian trekker who was hiking solo in Nepal's Langtang National Park earlier this year. Government officials believe that by requiring all hikers to have support staff with them at all times there will be a level of supervision and accountability in place that isn't there now. It should also ensure travelers remain safe while in remote areas of the country while also providing more jobs for local porters and guides. Hiring a guide or porter shouldn't have a significant impact on travel budgets for solo trekkers who are often experienced travelers looking to visit the Himalaya on the cheap. The government of Nepal estimates it will mean an increase of about $10 per day, which they believe will have no impact on the number of tourists who visit the country. A solo trek in Nepal has been a popular escape for adventure travelers for decades and it is a shame that it will no longer be an option.

The National Park Service, which conducted the study, says that even though many of the parks, such as Yellowstone and Yosemite, have seen record numbers of visitors in recent years, those travelers are actually spending 15 percent less time inside the park while they are there. Park officials say that a major reason why visits are now shorter than they were two decades ago is that an increasing number of travelers are booking their accommodations outside the park boundaries. Many of the larger parks actually have rustic lodges and campsites that have been popular places to stay for years, but it seems that fewer visitors are choosing to book them when they make their vacation plans. This accounts for at least a portion of the decline in the length of visits, as the study showed that 4.5 million fewer guests stayed the night inside the parks in 2011 than they did in 1994. That's down 25 percent in just 17 years. It seems that the parks are as popular as ever but camping isn't as viable of an option as it once was. This runs directly counter to market trends, which show that Americans have increased their spending on outdoor recreation an average of 5 percent over each of the past five years. Apparently that spending is going into other outdoor activities and travelers are electing to stay in a comfortable bed rather than a tent.","url" => "","source" => "www.gadling.com"),

Hipmunk uses a style of this data on their search engine called \"agony,\" which is a measure of suffering incurred by lower leg room, higher baggage fees and a variety of other variables that can make airline travel miserable. That level of duress can be applied to other experiences as well. To apply this to experiential travel, it's first useful to think about the influences presented to any person in motion. While external influences like class of service, traffic and weather affect every passenger, internal factors such as purpose (i.e., business, leisure, wedding or funeral), health and state of mind can vary by each person. Add up the external influences in parallel then multiply that number by each person's perspective, say, their Coefficient of Travel Tolerance (COTT), and one can produce a relative comparison between each experience. So someone with a low coefficient of travel tolerance (i.e., someone with a high tolerance for difficult travel) could handle a journey in a chicken bus just as well as someone with a high coefficient (i.e., someone who hates leaving home) could handle a flight in international first class.","url" => "","source" => "www.gadling.com")

As Time Techland reports, that means a mammoth amount of computing power will now be dedicated to \"studying everything from hurricanes and tornadoes to geomagnetic storms, tsunamis, wildfires, air pollution and the location of water beneath the earth��s surface.\" Called Yellowstone, the 100-rack supercomputer is divided into three main parts: a crazy fast performance cluster powered by 72,888 Intel Sandy Bridge EP processor cores, a huge 144.6 terabyte storage farm and then a system that visualizes all that data. All this amounts to a computer that is 30 times more powerful than its predecessor at NCAR, called Bluefire.

Stories like those are enough to make you want to keep them out of public hands entirely, but new research says that green laser pointers can actually be used for something good too. Researchers found that the hand-held lasers could be used to detect hazardous chemicals, even in very trace amounts. The researchers at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev used an ordinary green laser pointer to create a Raman spectrometer. According to The Optical Society, \"Raman spectrometers rely on highly focused beams of light at precise wavelengths to illuminate small samples of materials. Very sensitive detectors then study the spectra of light that has been re-emitted, or scattered, by the sample. Most of this scattered light retains its original frequency or color, but a very small percentage of that light is shifted ever so slightly to higher or lower wavelengths, depending on the unique vibrational modes of the sample being studied. By comparing the shifted and the original wavelengths, it��s possible to determine the precise chemicals present in the sample.\" The green laser pointer is especially well-suited in this set up because the short wavelength actually helped improve the detection of the spectrometer. Also, because the laser pointer allows the system to be small and easily manageable, the spectrometer can easily sweep across a sample to locate areas of greater interest and then examine those more closely.","url" => "","source" => "www.treehugger.com"),

Those models are backlighted with cold cathode fluorescent lamps or CCFLs, which contain mercury, making them hazardous to dispose of or incinerate. \"Over the next few years, it is expected that hundreds of millions of CCFL-backlighted LCDs will retire each year,\" said Fu Zhao, an assistant professor in the School of Mechanical Engineering and Division of Environmental and Ecological Engineering. \"Without proper treatment, these used LCDs could lead to serious damage to the environment.\" While LCD hardware typically has a lifespan of 10 to 20 years, most people don't hang on to it that long. Technology advances and the constant release of new models of electronics means people are upgrading more frequently than that. To tackle that problem, the researchers are working to develop a new way to recycle these displays that doesn't involve incineration or shipping them overseas. Electronics contain toxic materials like heavy metals and brominated flame retardants that can leach into ground water or turn into \"super toxicants\" like dioxin when incinerated, so safe disposal is incredibly important.

Robo-fish are nothing new, we've covered a few versions here before, from amazingly realistic-looking ones that scan the open ocean for pollutants to those that lead other fish away from danger, like turbines of power plants or oil spills, but these have the special task of monitoring the water in and around Europe's harbors, where the constant in and out of ships has lead to a lot of non-policed polluting. \"The idea is that we want to have real-time monitoring of pollution, so that if someone is dumping chemicals or something is leaking, we can get to it straight away, find out what is causing the problem and put a stop to it,\" explains Luke Speller, a senior scientist at the research division of BMT Group, which is part of the consortium, to BBC News. Right now, contamination testing is done in harbors only once a month, which leaves plenty of time for ships to come in and leak chemicals that could move up the coastline well before the next test is done. With the robotic fish, a watchdog would always be in the water, which could help keep marine environments cleaner and hold shipping companies more responsible.","url" => "","source" => "www.treehugger.com"),

That's what a research project is setting out to explore, thanks to a collaboration between researchers at City University of Hong Kong and their neighboring Starbucks stores. According to the American Chemical Society (ACS), the idea for applying the researcher's biorefinery technology to the wastes of a food business such as Starbucks came during a meeting between a university research team led by Carol S. K. Lin and a non-profit organization, The Climate Group. Lin was asked about using the biorefinery concept to treat the food waste products from the Hong Kong Starbucks, which generate well over 4000 tons of waste every year. The team was already well versed in biorefineries, but addressing the food waste issue called for developing a new approach in order to build a \"food biorefinery\", which would produce succinic acid - a material used as an ingredient in many other products, from plastics to detergents to medicine. The new process developed by the researchers starts by blending a mixture of fungi with the baked goods and other waste, and the fungi then excrete enzymes to break the carbohydrates down into simple sugars.

At the bronze level, companies commit to collect and send less than 50 percent of their e-waste (by weight) to certified recyclers annually.

Looking at the ratio of hydrogen to its heavy isotope deuterium in frozen water (H2O), scientists can get an idea of the relative distance from the Sun at which objects containing the water were formed. Objects that formed farther out should generally have higher deuterium content in their ice than objects that formed closer to the Sun, and objects that formed in the same regions should have similar hydrogen isotopic compositions. Therefore, by comparing the deuterium content of water in carbonaceous chondrites to the deuterium content of comets, it is possible to tell if they formed in similar reaches of the Solar System.","url" => "http://www.astromart.com/news/news.asp?news_id=1283","source" => "www.astromart.com"),

During this feast they spill a lot of their \"food,\" which is discharged in turbulent outbursts. An international team of astronomers has revealed some striking features of such an outburst around a supermassive black hole in a distant galaxy. They found a very hot \"convertor\" corona hovering above the black hole and cold gas \"bullets\" in hotter diffuse gas, speeding outwards with velocities up to 700 km/s. Unlike popular belief, not all the matter around a black hole is swallowed up. A disc of infalling gas forms around the black hole. On the journey inwards the gas and dust emit large amounts of X-ray and UV radiation. This radiation can be so strong that it diverts a part of the gas inflow. It causes winds flowing outward with velocities up to several hundreds of km/s. An international team of astronomers led by Dr. Jelle Kaastra from the SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research took the opportunity to observe and map such an extreme environment around one of the brightest supermassive black holes known to us.

It also is one of only two galaxies to show that such activity occurred in three separate episodes. Giant jets of superfast particles are powered by supermassive black holes at the cores of galaxies. Both elliptical and spiral galaxies harbor such black holes, but only Speca and one other spiral galaxy have been seen to produce large jets. The jets pour outward from the poles of rapidly-rotating disks of material orbiting the black hole.

				array("title"=>"Transfer treadmill slowing down","description" => "Constantly improving, FIFA\'s Transfer Matching System (TMS) continues to provide an ever clearer picture of the frenetic activity that takes place during each transfer window.Information regarding the international transfers facilitated by FIFA TMS in the first half of 2012 has now been released in a Biannual Report, and the document sheds valuable light on player movements in the first six months of the year, while also enabling comparisons with the same period in 2011.The report is based solely on the details of each individual transaction entered directly into the TMS by professional clubs between 1 January and 30 June 2012, and concerns the international transfers of male association football players.Perhaps the most notable statistic to emerge from the report is that nine per cent fewer international transfers were completed in the first half of this year compared to the same period in 2011.A total of 4,973 player moves were recorded, with 72 per cent of those deals concerning players out of contract at the moment of their transfer. There was also a three per cent drop in terms of transfers arising out of agreements between clubs, 55 per cent coming in the form of a permanent deal or a loan with financial compensation.Russia spending big, Brazil counting gainsThose were by no means the only indicators that transfer activity is down this year, with the transaction of USD 576m �C 86 per cent of which was spent on fixed transfer fees �C recorded in the TMS.That represented a decrease of USD 294m or 34 per cent compared to the same period in 2011, and the overriding factor behind that drop is surely the international recession and the impact it has had on professional clubs. In addition, wealth is now overwhelmingly concentrated among a select few national associations, while UEFA\'s Financial Fair Play regulations are prompting sides to act more prudently in the market.Player movement nonetheless remains a global phenomenon, as no fewer than 157 of FIFA\'s 209 member associations were involved in one or more international transfers during the first half of the year. Of those, Brazil was the most active, with 700 players either entering or leaving the country, putting it far ahead of second-placed England on 326.In terms of the sums paid, no association spent more than Russia, where clubs laid out a total of USD 64.4m, though Portuguese teams invested more per deal, spending an average of USD 3.4m on each move involving a fee.With a combined outlay of USD 57.4m, France was third on the overall list behind Russia and Brazil and ahead of England, Spain and China PR �C despite Paris Saint-Germain\'s most recent high-profile deals coming after the six-month cut-off point. Brazilian sides received the most money from transfer fees, meanwhile, adding USD 64.9m to their coffers.To read the report in full, click the link in the column on the right.","url"=>"","source"=>""),

That means the speculation will never stop...It was the Swiss Federal Court that decided to make the publication of the ISL non-prosecution order anonymous. As far as I am concerned, the whole document could have been published \'clean\', to put an end to the speculation once and for all. However, the Federal Court stated that the ��names of all non-accused third parties�� should be made anonymous. I am not accused, so I have been made anonymous as P1, which quite honestly is not difficult to find out.You��re supposed to have known.Known what? That commission was paid? Back then, such payments could even be deducted from tax as a business expense. Today, that would be punishable under law. You can��t judge the past on the basis of today��s standards. Otherwise it would end up with moral justice. I can��t have known about an offence that wasn��t even one.The case has been closed from a legal point of view. But isn��t there still an ethical question to be answered?Of course. That is why we have started to strengthen our control mechanisms: to prevent something like this happening in the future. The Ethics Committee, which was created in 2006 on my initiative, is a direct result of the ISL case. The reform process is moving exactly in this direction. To strengthen FIFA��s judicial system, some important steps have already been taken with the introduction of a two-chamber system �C an adjudicatory body and an investigatory body.

Such a suspension would jeopardise the participation of Oman in the 2014 FIFA World Cup? qualifiers and in other international competitions, and would also mean that neither the OFA nor any of its members or officials could benefit from any development programme, course, or training from FIFA or AFC while the OFA is suspended.","url"=>"","source"=>""),

The remaining percentage is often made of composite materials like carbon fiber which strengthens the paddle and provides a large sweet spot or aralyte, which helps dampen vibration and has a softer feel than carbon. Beginners don��t need to buy one with carbon layers just yet as they still need to develop their skills and playing style.Rubbers can be smooth or reverse type or pimpled or pips. Start with a quality smooth rubber on both sides because these allow you to try and develop various play styles before focusing on a specific one for professional play. Pimples or short pips are good only for limited strokes and spins and are ideal for more specialized playing styles.In between the rubbers and the blade is a layer of sponge measuring anywhere from 1.2 mm to 2.5 mm thick. A thin sponge layer gives you better control and is best suited for beginners who are developing their game while a thicker sponge gives less control but faster speeds suitable for more seasoned players.","url"=>"","source"=>""),

Stenning said the committee did not consider expulsion because it was believed that would require a criminal conviction.Hewitt, who is 72 and lives in South Africa, also was permanently removed from the South African Sport and Arts Hall of Fame on Friday, a spokesman said.A man who answered Hewitt\'s South African-listed cellphone number said he was \"not available for comment.\"The Weekend Post newspaper in South Africa quoted him last year as saying, \"I only want to apologize if I offended anyone in any way.\"Stenning said Hewitt\'s plaque in the Tennis Hall and other references to him there and on the Hall\'s website, were removed Thursday. The website had called him an \"enduringly elegant player\" and a \"master of the doubles craft.\"\"His legacy ceases to exist in the Hall of Fame,\" Stenning said.Suellen Sheehan, who accuses Hewitt of raping her when she was 9 years old and was one of his tennis proteges in South Africa, told the AP on Friday that she stayed up late into the night to hear news that he had been removed from the Tennis Hall.\"He will never ever go up on that wall. My work is done,\" said Sheehan, now 43 and a businesswoman in Johannesburg. \"That is what I set out to do. To all people out there who feel that they will never be heard or believed, you know, we have now been believed.\"Sheehan said she and three other alleged victims of Hewitt\'s abuse had been pushed by the Hall of Fame to pursue a criminal case against him so that they could act.A criminal investigator in South Africa was handling her case, Sheehan said, and the four alleged victims who decided to pursue the case together had \"a good chance of justice.\"\"For all intents and purposes we wanted to remove him from the Hall because he didn\'t deserve to be there. But he still needs to go to jail,\" Sheehan said.Sheehan said the International Tennis Hall decision would now put pressure on South African authorities to investigate Hewitt, who is believed to live in a seaside town on South Africa\'s south coast.Twiggy Tolken, another alleged victim, said in an email to the AP from New Zealand -- where she lives after having left South Africa -- that she was \"overwhelmed\" at the news.\"We have all waited a very long time for the HOF to make a decision, sometimes even thinking they would not,\" Tolken wrote. \"I am extremely happy they made the right decision. Bob Hewitt has got away with far too much for far too long.\"Sheehan and Tolken both agreed to be named. The AP typically doesn\'t identify people who say they were sexually abused unless they agree.Ryan McGee of the South African Sports Hall said that Hewitt had also been removed from that institution\'s roll of honor immediately. He was inducted in 2006.Attorney Michael Connolly of the firm Hinckley, Allen & Snyder, which the International Tennis Hall hired to conduct the inquiry into the allegations, said he interviewed more than two dozen people over several months. He spent 10 hours interviewing Hewitt, who was accompanied by two South African lawyers, in September, but would not characterize those discussions.Connolly said he pursued every lead he came across. \"We identified as many of the victims as we could, spoke to them, spoke to their family members and spoke to a host of others with relevant information,\" he said.Connolly presented his initial findings to the executive committee in September, then made a final presentation to the panel in New York City on Wednesday, according to Stenning. Not all members of the committee were in attendance, but everyone who was there voted in favor of indefinitely suspending Hewitt.The Hall changed its bylaws this year to allow for both suspension and expulsion.Among those Connolly interviewed was Heather Conner, of West Newbury, Mass. She says she was sexually abused by Hewitt from age 15, when she says he forced her to have sex with him near a high school in Massachusetts.Conner had been critical of the Hall for not taking action sooner and had sought Hewitt\'s expulsion. She was surprised -- and pleased -- by the Hall\'s decision.\"Honestly, I really didn\'t think they were going to do anything,\" she said. \"I\'m thankful that they\'ve listened and heard. It feels good to be believed.\"","url"=>"","source"=>""),

				array("title"=>"Players shun disgraced doctor del Moral","description" => "PARIS -- The owner of a leading tennis academy in Spain that trained some of the sport\'s stars says its players have stopped working with a doctor banned by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency for helping riders on Lance Armstrong\'s cycling team dope.Pancho Alvarino told The Associated Press the relationship between his TenisVal academy and doctor Luis Garcia del Moral \"started approximately 14-15 years ago.\"That overlaps with del Moral\'s work for the U.S. Postal Service cycling team. The USADA says del Moral helped to implement a \"team-wide doping program\" as a doctor for USPS from 1999-2003, when Armstrong won the first five of seven Tour de France titles that have been stripped from him for doping.The USADA handed the doctor a lifetime sports ban in July. Del Moral criticized the agency\'s proceedings and said he never witnessed organized doping at USPS.Replying by email to questions from the AP, Alvarino said \"many of our players\" consulted del Moral for preseason blood tests, strength tests and for injuries. He said TenisVal used the information to tailor specific training programs for each player.If there had been any indication that del Moral was doping academy players, \"I would have denounced the doctor, as well as the player,\" Alvarino said.He indicated the academy has now severed the link with del Moral. \"After Armstrong\'s news, no player from TenisVal has (had) contact or any kind of relationship with him,\" he wrote.Players paid the doctor\'s clinic directly, Alvarino said, adding that TenisVal coaches always accompanied players on visits to del Moral. TenisVal and del Moral\'s clinic are both in Valencia, on Spain\'s east coast.\"Dr. Del Moral has been always a very important personality in sports medicine in Valencia and he has worked with many sports people and sports teams from many countries, as everybody knows,\" wrote Alvarino, a former player, and captain of Spain\'s first Fed Cup-winning team, in 1991.Sara Errani of Italy, the losing finalist in women\'s singles at the 2012 French Open, said in September that del Moral \"was the best doctor in Valencia for everything, so I have been working with him, of course.\"Errani added she would no longer consult him because \"his name is not (a) good name.\"Former top-ranked woman Dinara Safina of Russia also consulted del Moral when she was at TenisVal. Russian website Sport Express last month quoted Safina as saying del Moral \"has the only real clinic in Valencia where athletes can undergo tests before the beginning of the season and at the end. And we underwent the tests in this clinic. We ran on the treadmill, they took blood samples from our ears, and so on.\"\"Del Moral gave us no advice whatsoever and did not handle our cases,\" Sport Express quoted Safina as saying. \"I have nothing to be afraid of. I\'m clean.\"The manager of the International Tennis Federation\'s anti-doping program, Stuart Miller, said he investigated del Moral\'s work in tennis in the wake of the USADA\'s ban.The ITF \"interviewed Sara Errani, among others,\" Miller told the AP. Citing confidentiality requirements, he wouldn\'t reveal details of the investigation or say if the ITF determined whether del Moral helped players to dope.\"If there\'s a case where somebody has breached the rules, it will be publicly reported,\" Miller said. \"So you can draw what conclusions you like from that.\"Del Moral has disputed the USADA\'s evidence against him.In a statement posted last month on the website of the Valencia clinic where he works, he said: \"During the years that I was with the medical team of U.S. Postal I never was witness to doping organized by the team, nor of course any that I (supposedly) facilitated or promoted.\"\"Beyond a doubt, I have not participated in any doping ring, nor has it been proven,\" the statement said.In affidavits, former Armstrong teammates told the USADA that del Moral drew up doping plans, injected them and supplied them with the banned blood-boosting hormone EPO as well as testosterone, human growth hormone and cortisone, and helped extract and re-infuse blood for banned performance-enhancing transfusions.","url"=>"","source"=>""),
				array("title"=>"Federer calls for quicker courts to promote attack","description" => "LONDON -- With the top defensive players increasingly getting the better of him often in recent years, Roger Federer would like to speed up the game of tennis.Or at least the courts the matches are played on.Federer lost to Novak Djokovic in the final of the season-ending ATP finals on Monday, and then praised the top-ranked Serb\'s ability to retrieve so many shots and keep the ball in play. That\'s a trait Djokovic shares with Federer\'s other two biggest rivals -- Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray -- and the Swiss star said attacking play doesn\'t always reap the benefits it deserves even on hard courts because they\'re often slower than they used to be.\"It\'s an easy fix. Just make quicker courts, then it\'s hard to defend,\" Federer said. \"Attacking style is more important. It\'s only on this type of slow courts that you can defend the way we are all doing right now.\"Monday\'s final at the O2 Arena had a familiar feel to it. Federer did most of the attacking, trying to dictate play with his forehand and aggressive shot making. But Djokovic, as he often does, kept finding ways to get the ball back over the net and was sharper on the key points.Federer won the first nine points of the match and was up an early break in both sets, but Djokovic recovered to win 7-6 (6), 7-5.Federer was the two-time defending champion in London and emphasized that he was happy with this court, calling it one of the faster indoor surfaces on the circuit. He said slower courts are also good for long rallies -- which are a big crowd pleaser -- but that having more variety in the surfaces would force players to learn to be more aggressive.\"What you don\'t want is that you hit 15 great shots and at the end, it ends up in an error,\" he said. \"So I think sometimes quicker courts do help the cause. I think it would help from time to time to move to something a bit faster. That would help to learn, as well, for many different players, different playing styles, to realize that coming to the net is a good thing, it\'s not a bad thing.\"Federer has won a record-equaling seven Wimbledon titles on grass, the quickest surface, but has only one French Open title on the slower clay, where Nadal has repeatedly thwarted him.Djokovic and Murray also rely heavily on their great defensive abilities, which have helped set them apart from the rest of the pack.Having more tournaments played on faster surfaces could make it easier for other players to challenge the sport\'s \"Big Four,\" Federer said, adding that he wasn\'t sure tournament directors would necessarily buy into that.\"I think some variety would be nice, some really slow stuff and then some really fast stuff, instead of trying to make everything sort of the same,\" he said. \"You sort of protect the top guys really by doing that because you have the best possible chance to have them in the semis at this point, I think. But should that be the goal? I\'m not sure.\"Djokovic said his strategy against Federer is usually to try and extend the rallies and hope for an opportunity.\"He\'s somebody that is very aggressive, that likes to finish points very quickly,\" Djokovic said. \"But I managed to get a lot of shots back into the court, being passive, a couple meters behind the baseline. ... That was one of the goals tonight, to always try to get him into the longer rallies where I think I had the better chance.\"","url"=>"","source"=>""),
				array("title"=>"ITF considering greater anti-doping measures","description" => "PARIS -- Tennis is considering whether to adopt blood-testing measures used by cycling and track to catch drug cheats.\"We are looking very, very carefully at an athlete biological passport program in tennis,\" International Tennis Federation anti-doping manager Stuart Miller told The Associated Press in a phone interview.Biological passport programs in cycling and in track and field monitor athletes\' blood readings over time for possible tell-tale indications of doping. The federations for those sports, the UCI and the IAAF, have used evidence of doping gathered from these programs to ban athletes and target others for more testing.Miller said \"it would be nice\" if tennis can establish such a system in 2013.\"I don\'t want to say it\'s definitely happening until we actually say, `Here\'s a program. It\'s up and running,\" Miller said. \"We\'re looking at it to ensure that if we do run it, we can run it properly.\"Miller said the ITF also is working toward more of the blood and out-of-competition drug tests it already does on players.In the wake of cyclist Lance Armstrong\'s life ban from sports for doping, Roger Federer and Andy Murray called for more out-of-competition and blood testing in tennis.Murray called the Armstrong case \"pretty shocking.\"\"You would hate for anything like that to happen to your own sport,\" Murray said before the season-ending ATP finals in London.Federer said: \"We don\'t do a lot of blood testing during the year. I\'m OK having more of that.\"The ITF and the World Anti-Doping Agency conducted just 21 out-of-competition blood tests -- used to detect the abuse of growth hormone, transfusions using blood from donors, and blood-doping substances CERA and HBOCs -- in tennis in 2011.The vast majority of tests in tennis in 2011 -- 2,019 of a total of 2,150 -- were urine.\"We\'re working hard to try to increase the proportion of out-of-competition testing, and particularly blood testing, and we\'ve been working on that for a while,\" Miller said. \"I\'m hopeful that by the end of the year, we\'ll have made some inroads into improving that.\"Like any anti-doping program, we\'re subject to resource constraints.\"Miller told the AP that the ITF tested Federer an average of eight times per year from 2004-2006, 11 times per year from 2007-2009 and nine times per year in 2010-2012.Just three of the out-of-competition blood tests in 2011 were on female tennis players. ITF statistics on its web site show it didn\'t test Serena Williams out of competition at all in 2010 and 2011, years she won the Australian Open and Wimbledon and lost a U.S. Open final.The ITF did test Williams in-competition at least seven times in 2010 and between 1-3 times in-competition in 2011.\"I get tested a lot,\" Williams said last month at the WTA Championships in Istanbul, Turkey. \"For me, it\'s a pretty intense system, and I know a lot of the players feel the same way.\"The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency\'s web site shows that before one test in the second quarter of this year, it hadn\'t organized a test on the 15-time major winner since 2008.Li Na, the 2011 French Open women\'s singles winner from China, also was not tested out of competition by the ITF or WADA in 2011 or in 2010, but was tested in-competition.Of the 642 tested tennis players, 510 were not tested out of competition at all in 2011 -- when athletes aren\'t playing between events or in the offseason.Cycling conducted 6,500 more tests than tennis on professional road racers last year and an average of nine tests per rider, compared to an average 3.4 tests per player in tennis.By way of comparison, Canadian cyclist Ryder Hesjedal, winner of the Giro d\'Italia, has had 22 urine tests and 13 blood controls so far this year.The ITF budget shows it spent $1.3 million on testing in 2011, which Miller said doesn\'t include salaries and other operating expenses.That is less than Federer and Williams each pocketed for winning the men and women\'s singles titles at Wimbledon this year.Cycling says it spent $4.7 million on testing alone in 2011, with teams, riders, race organizers and the UCI all contributing.","url"=>"","source"=>"")

Though the pic doesn��t open stateside until next Friday, Skyfall made one hell of a splash with its international debut this past weekend.  The film dominated the foreign box office, raking in a whopping $77.7 million in total.  $32.4 million of that came from from its U.K. debut, where it broke a couple of records. The $32.4 million garnered in the U.K. gave Skyfall the second highest opening weekend in history (per THR), behind the 3D-enhanced Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows �C Part 2.  In addition, the pic broke the all-time Saturday attendance record in the U.K.  This debut is a fantastic feat given the film��s lack of 3D (and therefore lack of higher ticket prices), though IMAX accounted for $3.5 million of the film��s total box office take.  Skyfall opened on 79 IMAX theaters in 15 territories, netting the format��s largest opening ever for a non-holiday, non-summer title.  The film also broke the record for the highest opening weekend ever for a Bond film in Brazil.","url" => "","source" => "www.rottentomatoes.com"),

It might mean a few hours of lost sleep, but for savings like these, that\'s not a tremendous sacrifice.One caveat to the Black Friday bargain hunting: if you\'re hoping to find a discounted Wii U �� or even a cheap version of uber-hot titles Black Ops II or Halo 4 �� you\'re largely out of luck. Nintendo\'s new console is likely to sell out, regardless of price, and both new games are selling so well that there\'s no incentive for Activision or Microsoft (or their retail partners) to drop the price.Hardware deals will be omnipresent, though. Virtually every retailer will offer an Xbox 360 or a PlayStation 3 (both equipped with 250GB of memory and couple of games) for $200. The PlayStation Vita is being bundled with one of several games for $200 as well. And a flame red Nintendo 3DS (with Super Mario 3D Land pre-installed) will run $150-$170.As for software, there are plenty of great gaming deals around that will keep you happy.

Back catalog hits are also cheaper: $15 will fetch you Grand Theft Auto IV: The Complete Edition or 2010\'s Halo Reach (among other titles).Wal-MartWal-Mart on Black Friday can be a terrifying experience �� especially during the door buster hours. But there are some great deals for the brave (or foolhardy).Epic Mickey 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, FIFA Soccer 13, NBA 2K13, Borderlands 2, Medal of Honor Warfighter, and Just Dance 4 will all run you a mere $25 �� better than 50% off.  For $15, you can pick up Dance Central 3, Max Payne 3, the original Black Ops, and Spec Ops: The Line. Another 25 titles are available for $10.Even the typically pricey Skylanders: Giants will cost you just $39, and you can pick up extra Skylanders figurines for $10. And if $200 is still too much for an Xbox 360, you can get the 4GB version (along with Skylanders) for $149.AmazonIf you\'re more of a stay-at-home-in-your-PJs kind of shopper, Amazon\'s planning several lightning deals throughout the week to lure you away from your money.There are a handful of bargains up through Wednesday for older games, but the real push starts on Thanksgiving.

Last February, Xbox World said that the redesigned controller would come with a built-in HD touch screen.Microsoft is also eyeing AR (augmented reality) glasses for the 720 at some future stage.Codenamed Durango, the new Xbox would be powered by a CPU with \"four hardware cores, each divided into four logical cores\" and 8GB of RAM.Dan Dawkins, Xbox World\'s editor in chief, told CVG that \"Xbox World has been at the cutting edge of Durango coverage for over 12 months. Unless something really dramatic changes, everything...will be revealed long before E3 in June.\"CNET contacted Microsoft for comment and will update the story if we get any information.","url"=>"","source"=>""),

He or she may well be in a position to save your life someday.A study at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston decided to pit a number of groups against each other to see who performed better using virtual surgery tools. The contestants? High-school sophomore gamers, college gamers and medical residents.In the end, the high-school students won.\"We wanted to see their results compared to our physicians and they did slightly better �� than our physicians in training,\" says Dr. Sami Kilic, Director of Texas Robotic Gynecology for UTMB. \"And some of those physicians in training have already participated in actual cases. It tells me that [the] knowledge and skills gained from computer games [is easily] implemented into the robotic surgeries.\"Each group was asked to perform a series of tasks with the device that replicated surgeries. All totaled, 32 skill sets were tested, ranging from hand-eye coordination to pressure on the controls.Ultimately, the high schoolers, who played video games for an average of two hours per day, slightly bested the college students (who played four hours per day) and residents (who generally hadn\'t played at all).Given the performance discrepancy between college and high school gamers, Kalic says the next step is to learn if there is an optimal number of hours to spend in front of games.Video games have been shown to be beneficial to doctors and budding doctors before. In 2008, a study found that playing Wii games like Marble Mania helped surgical residents improve their fine motor skills and improved their performance on surgical simulators.","url"=>"","source"=>""),

According to Guinness rules, players are granted one ten-minute break every hour, and any unspent time is accumulated. By skipping several breaks, Kaya was able to actually catch a little sleep and stay in relatively good spirits.Unsupervised gaming marathons have, in the past, resulted in tragedies. In July a Taiwanese man collapsed and died following a 40-hour Diablo III marathon at an internet caf��. Last year, an American gamer suffered a pulmonary embolism during a 20-hour Xbox session.Official record-breaking attempts are closely monitored, however, and Kaya was accompanied at all times by a rotating crew of supporters and witnesses. He also exercised and alternated between sitting and standing positions while he played.And make no mistake: he really played the game. By the end of his session, Kaya was ranked 37th on the Black Ops II leaderboards. The game itself is a record-breaker as well, earning over $500 million in its first 24 hours.","url"=>"","source"=>""),
				array("title"=>"Nintendo Hits a Few Hurdles in Wii U Launch","description" => "System launches from Nintendo tend to be smooth running affairs, but the ambitious nature of the Wii U has presented a few stumbling blocks for the company.(Credit: Nintendo)Within hours of the next generation console\'s debut, new owners were grumbling about a system update that kept them from playing for an hour or more, sporadic system outages and anticipated features that were delayed at the last minute.It\'s a notable blunder for Nintendo, whose corporate philosophy has historically been in line with that of Apple: A system should be easy to set up and work straight out of the box.Technically, the Wii U does work. Anyone who buys one can play a single player game as soon as they get it home and set up, but Nintendo has touted the system\'s multiplayer and social aspects as a big part of its marketing. And to access those, owners were forced to download and install a sizable patch (which some reports say was as big as 5 GB).Installing that patch took most users an hour or more �� and some reported it took up to four hours. During that time, the system was unusable.\"The company was too proud to say \'our online isn\'t ready and let\'s delay the launch to April\' �� which in retrospect maybe they should have,\" says Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities. \"It\'s a delicate balancing act. You can\'t keep everybody happy. What Nintendo decided to do when they decided to join this generation is do a whole lot of things at once�� This is an ambitious undertaking for them. And I think the gaming community doesn\'t understand how hard it is to pull off.\"A handful of owners found downloading that system update to be especially frustrating, after the Wii U refused to connect to their home WiFi systems. A workaround was quickly discovered by one user and placed on the Nintendo message board, but it\'s a complicated process that\'s likely to intimidate any mass-market consumers who braved the lines to buy the device.The complaints didn\'t end with the system update, though. The Wii U\'s online user hub, called the \'Miiverse,\' quickly buckled under user demand.\"Oops. So many Miis have jumped on Miiverse that some may be having problems connecting to the service. We are in the engine room getting it fixed!,\" the company wrote on Facebook. (The problems were resolved by the end of the day.)Some users were also upset by the last-minute delays to non-gaming functionality, including Hulu, Amazon on Demand and Nintendo\'s own Nintendo TVii, which is aimed at improving discoverability for both over the air and online programming. (Users will be able to search programming from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and live TV �� as well as content on their Tivo DVR. Unlike the Xbox, though, families can set individual profiles for each member, allowing each to pick favorites �� and allowing their friends to make recommendations.)Analysts say that while the problems were disappointing, they\'re not likely to affect demand for the system. Instead, they say, it underscores the big leap Nintendo was trying to make with the new system. Users, they say, might complain in online forums, but they\'ll be largely forgiving �� for a while. (Read More: \'Game Over\' for Videogame Makers This Holiday?)\"They really need to get this fixed quickly,\" says Billy Pidgeon, senior analyst at Inside Network. \"They don\'t get a free pass on this until the other consoles (from Microsoft and Sony) come out.\" (Read More: 10 Must-Have Videogames This Holiday Season, 2012)Overall demand for the Wii U seemed to be strong, but not overwhelming (as it was for the Wii six years ago). There were reports of stores in both Boston and Los Angeles still having stock at the end of the day.\"Our field checks suggest solid early demand for Wii-U, with roughly half of the stores in our survey sold out of initial shipments (mostly GameStop), and most of the other half (largely \'big box\' retailers) reporting low inventory levels,\" says Colin Sebastian of R.W. Baird. \"While the launch overall appears to be tracking to expectations, we are not seeing a buying frenzy similar to the original Wii launch.\"On eBay, a fairly reliable way to gauge supply and demand of new electronics, re-sellers have already managed to unload some 2,000 Wii U consoles. The average eBay sales price for the Wii U Deluxe, says Sebastian, is $488 (a 40 percent markup), while the $300 basic version of the system is selling for $389 online �� 30 percent higher than its retail price.That\'s well below the rates the Wii was commanding in its heyday as well. But analysts say that\'s less an issue of the system\'s launch stumbles and more tied to the current state of the traditional video game industry.\"The only thing that they\'ve really done wrong is they tried too hard to be first,\" says Pachter. \"I think they committed to a fall 2012 launch and there was a lot of blocking and tackling that they weren\'t ready for. It just shows how difficult it is to compete in this sector.\"","url"=>"","source"=>""),
				array("title"=>"Review: Innovative Wii U is a work in progress","description" => "Six years after changing the game with the release of the Wii, Nintendo is aiming to give the game industry a much-needed shot in the arm with the ambitious Wii U. To do so, they\'re waggling goodbye to living room calisthenics and taking a bold step into the future of dual-screen gaming.Releasing Sunday, the system\'s chief selling point is the GamePad, a wireless tablet-like controller that boasts a 6.2-inch touchscreen. This might seem like an innocuous gimmick, but the built-in second screen opens the door to a wealth of interesting features, including several that reach beyond the console\'s gaming focus.Unfortunately, focus has been missing from Nintendo\'s attempts to explain what the Wii U can and cannot do.  This wasn\'t an issue for the original Wii: you picked up the controller, you swung it around, you hit a tennis ball, you smiled, you did it again. The Wii U seems to have everyone a bit baffled. What, exactly, is this new gaming gadget, and should you get one?Let\'s clear up one misconception about the Wii U right away: it\'s not just a controller, it\'s a brand new console. Two models are available: an 8GB Basic Set for $300 and a 32 GB Deluxe Set, which includes a copy of Nintendo Land and a few other extras, for $350.The hardware itself looks a lot like the Wii, but it\'s a couple of inches longer and enjoys a sexier silhouette that\'s more rounded than its angular forbear. It also brings Nintendo up to speed with competing consoles by outputting in HD and pleasantly comes packaged with an HDMI cable. It\'s certainly more powerful than the Wii, but don\'t expect the graphics to outperform the Xbox 360 and PS3.The GamePad is surprisingly comfortable and fairly lightweight, and you\'ll hardly notice the plethora of standard sticks, triggers, and buttons since most of the real estate is taken up by the touchscreen. The screen looks great, often delivering a tighter, brighter image that what\'s appearing on your TV.When it\'s charged, that is. The GamePad\'s successes are torpedoed by a lousy battery that produces only about three or four hours of play time on one charge. Oddly, charging forgoes the console\'s four USB ports and instead inconveniently requires a separate AC outlet. The console comes packaged with only one GamePad, but it\'s fully compatible with standard Wii remotes for multiplayer games (it\'s also fully backwards compatible with regular Wii games).Speaking of which, the system\'s 23 launch titles offer a handful of innovative experiences. Nintendo Land is a terrific collection of 12 mini-games (we know, we know) that do a great job of showing off the Wii U\'s bread-and-butter: dual-screen play.  In the surprisingly fun hide-and-seek game Mario Chase, for instance, one player controls Mario on the GamePad, while the others chase him down using Wii remotes.[Related: The 5 Wii U launch games you should buy first]Other titles use the GamePad in more daring ways. Ubisoft\'s excellent frightfest Zombi U turns the GamePad into a survival tool, letting players switch weapons, track zombies, or scan the environment by holding the device up to the TV. The critically-acclaimed New Super Mario Bros. U aims to bring gamers together by letting GamePad users summon blocks to help Mario reach new heights.Several games, including a revamped Wii U version of 2011 hit Batman: Arkham City, can be streamed directly to the GamePad\'s screen and off the TV entirely. The GamePad\'s got a decent range of about 25 feet, effectively untethering your console from the living room, a boon for families endlessly bickering over TV time.Nintendo is further positioning the Wii U as an all-in-one entertainment box by including apps for Amazon Instant Video, Hulu Plus, Youtube and Netflix. [Update: Netflix functionality is now live.] Unfortunately, these features aren\'t available yet, nor is Nintendo TVii, an app that turns the GamePad into a robust programming guide by putting your cable and online entertainment options in one handy, searchable spot. It\'s a frustrating delay, though it\'s reportedly coming in December.[Related: TV, movie features on new Wii U delayed until Dec.]Nintendo hits another speed bump in delivering the Wii U\'s online experience. Online functionality is not operable out of the box -- you\'ll have to download a chunky patch to get it working. Essential elements are tucked away here, including Friend Lists, an \'eShop\' granting access to downloadable games (including same-day digital versions of retail releases), a solid web browser, and a Twitter-like social network called Miiverse. It\'s a big step up from the lackluster online environment of the Wii, though the Wii U currently does not have any sort of unified gaming achievement system, a ubiquitous feature that\'s been ingrained in gamers through the Xbox 360, PS3, and even Apple\'s iOS Gamecenter.It\'s also hard to overlook the sluggish interface. Navigating the various apps and screens can be a bit awkward -- do you look at the TV or the GamePad? -- and launching programs seems to take a few seconds longer than it should. I\'ve also experienced two very jarring crashes while trying to load apps, both requiring me to unplug the console itself to reboot. Not cool.But is the Wii U? As is usually the case with a Nintendo system, that depends greatly on your particular needs and interests as a gamer. At its best, the Wii U offers several innovative features that can fundamentally change the way your family deals with its diverse entertainment needs, plus it finally brings Nintendo into the HD era. A handful of its launch games are genuinely unique and offer a glimpse into a compelling future, while the online options, limited though they may be, are promising. Nintendo fans staring at a dusty old Wii will doubtless be pleased with the Wii U.However, the console lacks the instant appeal of the original Wii, and the missing features and hefty patch give it a distinct \'beta test\' feel. The clock is ticking, too: upcoming consoles from Microsoft and Sony are expected to be announced next year. Will the Wii U have enough firepower to stand up to whatever\'s coming next? That\'s as tough to call as the Wii U is to recommend in its current state.","url"=>"","source"=>""),
				array("title"=>"The 5 Wii U launch games you should buy first","description" => "The launch of the Wii U is upon us, and if you\'re one of the early adopters who either pre-ordered a system or braved the crowds to pick one up Sunday, you\'ve probably got some ideas for which games to grab as well.So do we. We\'ve already spent some time with the majority of the Wii U launch lineup, and, like all launch lineups, it\'s a little hit or miss. Some games do a terrific job of showing off the system\'s unique features, while others will likely be forgotten in a few short months.Which are the keepers? Start with these five:New Super Mario Bros. UThe first Mario game to launch alongside brand new Nintendo hardware in over 15 years, New Super Mario Bros. U is likely the first game to catch the eye of Wii U owners. That\'s a good call, because it\'s a great game.Hearkening back to legendary 2D Mario classics like Super Mario World, it\'s an old-fashioned, Goomba-stomping side-scroller hiding all kinds of fantastic secrets and a few clever new modes. A new co-op component lets one person jump through a level while the other helps (or hinders) by dropping blocks using the GamePad, making it a wonderful pastime for parents and kids. And with loads of familiar but fresh gameplay, it\'s a good fit for just about everyone else, too.Zombi UDespite its kid-friendly rep, Nintendo\'s provided a home for some of the best survival-horror games ever (Eternal Darkness and Resident Evil 4 were both Gamecube titles). While it remains to be seen if Zombi U is one of the best of its breed, it easily makes the cut for the Wii U launch.The game offers multiple flavors for zombie aficionados. The solo campaign has you navigating the streets of London during an undead apocalypse, shooting down the hordes while using the GamePad as an all-in-one survival device. Should you die �� and you will �� you\'ll come back as a new survivor and can track down your former self (now a zombie) to reclaim equipment. Sound awesome? It is, as is the game\'s multiplayer. One person plays King of the Zombies, dropping undead beasties all over the map, while the other plays survivor and tries to fight them off.Nintendo LandIf you\'re buying a Wii U Deluxe Set ($350), this is the game that come packed in, so congrats -- you\'ve already got one of the five you\'ll want. If you opt for a Basic Set, we heartily advise grabbing a copy.While it won\'t knock out your friends and family as quickly as Wii Sports (remember the astonished look on your grandma\'s face when she bowled her first strike?), Nintendo Land is a terrific showpiece for the many features of the Wii U GamePad. You\'ll use its bright screen to hunt down other players as a ghost, play hide and seek as Mario, fling ninja stars at enemies, and much, much more.  The 12 mini-games offer a wide variety of experiences for both solo players and groups, and while they\'re not all hits �� an Octopus-themed dance game is a dud �� there are more than enough good times here to warrant a Day One buy.Batman: Arkham City: Armored EditionNintendo fans were rightly bummed that the best superhero game ever made wasn\'t released for the Wii, but they make up for it in a big way with this revamped version for the Wii U. It\'s the same core experience -- Batman must contend with hordes of villains in a gorgeous open-world Gotham -- but the Armored Edition is more than just a late port of a great game.The GamePad plays a major role this time, acting as a min-map, inventory hub, detective tool, and even playing environmental audio (such as helpful messages from Alfred) through the controller itself. And if the fam is fighting over the TV, Batman is one of the few Wii U Launch games that lets you play the entire experience directly on the GamePad itself.Mass Effect 3: Special EditionOne of the year\'s best role-playing games is unsurprisingly one of the best launch games for the Wii U. And while mass Effect 3 already hit the Xbox 360 and PS3 back in March, the Wii U version has been tailored to take advantage of the GamePad in ways that makes the experience feel right at home. You\'ll use the touchscreen to manage your character\'s inventory, keep track of your environment with a handy map, and even draw paths for your AI companions to follow.It\'s not perfect -- the fact that you can\'t carry over a save from prior Mass Effect titles hurts, and the simplistic \'Genesis\' comic book that lets you play catchup is a letdown  -- but this is still a wonderful role-playing game with more than enough depth to keep you glued to your Wii U for hours on end. That\'s exactly what a good launch game is all about.","url"=>"","source"=>""),

In a statement, the company said it wanted the service \"to be the best possible experience for all consumers.\" Nintendo said it was still working to \"make it available as soon as possible.\"The new service, Nintendo TVii, promises to take into account all the ways users watch movies, TV shows and sports.If you like the TV show \"Modern Family,\" for example, it will present you with a list of the show\'s episodes gathered from available sources, whether that\'s Hulu, Netflix or traditional cable TV.The Wii U is the first major game console to launch in six years.

Bing Gordon, a Kleiner Perkins partner and former chief creative officer at EA, was the first to notice the problems at the company starting in April.Facebook games, he noted, weren\'t growing -- and Zynga had no real mobile strategy at the time (which might be why it overpaid for Draw Something developer OMGPOP). Meanwhile, employee morale was down and many were thinking about jumping ship.Pincus has historically followed his gut when it comes to management decisions and styles, so Kleiner Perkins warned Campbell that he might not make much progress, but Campbell says he found Pincus very open to advice.Among the suggestions he seemingly has taken from the therapeutic conversations is the need to delegate more. After stripping John Schappert of his chief operating officer duties in August (and once again assuming them himself), Pincus named David Ko to the role this week. Another executive has been put in charge of all games.The idea is for Pincus to focus on high-level decisions.

Intended as a companion to the console game, it was supposed to be one of the handheld\'s biggest holiday titles.That\'s not going to happen, at least if critics have anything to say about it. Reviews of Declassified are just starting to roll in, but with an unthinkably low 29 rating on Metacritic, it\'s already got a shot at going down as the worst game of 2012.Game Informer calls the title \"appalling,\" \"a complete embarrassment for gaming\'s biggest franchise\" and \"an absolute mess,\" citing artificial intelligence that is literally suicidal (hiding behind a car and shooting into it until it explodes) and a ridiculously easy campaign mode, which reviewer Dan Ryckert completed in just 42 minutes.\"If you\'re looking for a fun single-player shooter experience, you\'d be hard pressed to find an experience less complete than Declassified,\" he writes. \"In dramatic fashion, it completely fails to live up to the high bar of quality gamers expect from the Call of Duty name.

While it\'s hard to say definitively, there are rumors that development and production of Declassified were severely rushed, with game makers having no more than 8 months to put the title together. Even for an annualized franchise, that\'s a Herculean task.The bigger question is what this might mean for Vita sales this holiday. Sony had high hopes that the game would give the Vita a sales boost during the holidays, even offering a bundle of the game and system.But if reviews remain this low -- and there\'s little reason to think they\'ll turn around in a significant way -- it could be more bad news for Sony\'s handheld gaming device.","url"=>"","source"=>""),

At least not past level one or so.Game Informer reports that a significant number of Xbox 360 copies of Lego Lord of the Rings errantly contain a demo disc.The good news? The error is only occurring for the Xbox 360 version. The bad news? It\'s occurring at all.The game, which releases Tuesday (you might have seen it out of the corner of your eye as you waited in line for Black Ops II), transforms Tolkien\'s three-part tale of Middle-Earth into another playful Lego video game adventure.  That means plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor as you guide the Fellowship against the forces of Sauron, though I doubt anyone laughed after opening up their copy of the game only to find a lousy demo disc inside.As it turns out, however, the demo disc itself actually contains the full game. Publisher Warner Bros. Interactive says that it\'s simply a misprinted label and has has issued a limited product recall, as well as this official statement:Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment is recalling a small number of LEGO The Lord of the Rings video games that were released for the Xbox 360? video game and entertainment system from Microsoft to Walmart, Target and Toys \'R\' Us in the United States with a disc labeling error. The discs in question are incorrectly labeled as demo discs, but those discs do contain the full game content and are fully functional. This error does not affect any other formats of the game. We are in the process of remanufacturing the discs and will get them to the stores as soon as possible.Consumers who purchased a copy of the Xbox 360 version of the game with the disc labeling error can contact customer support via email at support@wbgames.com or phone at 410-568-3680 for a replacement disc.Weirdly, that\'s not the only incorrect disc issue plaguing the week\'s new releases. Some owners of Call of Duty: Black Ops II for the PC reportedly found that the game\'s second installation disc actually contained information for the EA role-playing game Mass Effect 2 and was therefore unusable.","url"=>"","source"=>""),

Blame Call of Duty fever.  Countless gamers are expected to call in sick on account of Tuesday\'s release of Black Ops II, the anticipated sequel to 2010\'s Call of Duty: Black Ops and pretty much pre-destined to become the best-selling game -- and quite possibly the biggest media entertainment property, period -- of 2012.The new game takes a number of leaps forward by featuring a branching storyline, near-future weapons and tech, and a host of multiplayer tweaks and changes. It\'s been branded as the biggest Call of Duty game yet, and considering how much content developer Treyarch packed into the original Black Ops, that\'s saying something.But is it saying enough? Is Black Ops II worth a sick day?Reviewers are weighing in, and while it\'s not quite the critical home run Activision was hoping for, it\'s widely considered a success. Currently averaging an 85 on Metacritic, Black ops II does more than enough to justify a little self-imposed R&R.IGN, for one, thinks it\'s the complete package.\"While large portions of the design conform to the tenets established by prior iterations of the franchise, the unparalleled wealth of gameplay options and brilliant twists on the formula have shaped Black Ops II into the most ambitious and exciting Call of Duty ever made,\" writes reviewer Anthony Gallegos.[Related: Whoops! Call of Duty: Black Ops II stars Petraeus as Defense Secretary]He\'s also a fan of the game\'s new branching campaign (\"a narrative worth replaying just to see the wildly different moments and endings\"), though the real joy is, as always, the game\'s big, over-the-top action.\"Shooting is as fun and precise as ever, and alongside the abundance of gigantic explosions, vehicle missiona dn intense firefights, it feels like the closest thing most of us will ever get to starring in an action film,\" he adds. His mark? A stellar 9.4/10.Machinima\'s Rob Smith is also a fan �� he gives it a 9/10 �� but takes issue with the game\'s new Strike Force missions, which lets gamers command other units against enemy forces. It\'s a strategy game blended into your shooter, but it just doesn\'t work very well.\"It\'s one of those steps off the reservation that you want to applaud, but the execution will be one of the great polarizing gameplay decisions,\" he laments.What works much better, however, is the game\'s revamped Zombie mode, featuring an open-world gameplay type called Tranzit which drops you and some friends into a rickety bus smack in the middle of an undead wasteland.To Games Radar, it\'s just as awesome as it sounds.\"Tranzit expands Zombies from a traditional horde mode to a full apocalyptic adventure,\" writes Lorenzo Veloria in a 4.5/5 review. \"You\'ll spend hours exploring and experimenting in Tranzit\'s open world, and when you and your friends unlock something new, the return for your effort is extremely rewarding.\"The game\'s bread and butter -- its best-in-class multiplayer -- is also roundly applauded, particularly the \'Pick 10\' system that lets players deeply customize their characters.\"Treyarch took a big risk with the Pick 10 create-a-class system, and it paid off, reimagining how players customize their experience,\" writes Russ Frushtick from Polygon. \"They could have stopped there, but the developer\'s drive to go deeper, changing certain core elements of Call of Duty multiplayer to encourage more teamwork, makes Black Ops 2 online play even more remarkable. No other online shooter is offering a better experience right now.\" Still, his glowing praise for the multiplayer is tempered by a general dislike of the single-player experience, leading to just an 8/10 score.He\'s not alone with that judgment. Gamespot (8/10), Giant Bomb (4/5), and Joystiq (4/5) come in with a mix of praise and criticism, offering a variety of opinions about the single-player and multiplayer experiences. But everyone seems to agree that while it isn\'t quite as innovative as Activision and Treyacrh would have us believe, Black Ops II is still a cold worth catching.","url"=>"","source"=>""),

That beats the record \"Halo 3\" set in 2007 of $170 million in first-day sales.Microsoft said the first week of sales are on track to top $300 million, which is exactly what \"Halo 3\" did five years ago.With those one-week sales numbers still coming in, Microsoft said that the latest game is on track to surpass its predecessors one-week global sales, but it\'s not able to say by exactly how much.However, \"Halo 4\" is about to face a formidable rival: On Tuesday, Activision Blizzard launches a massive rival game��\"Call of Duty: Black Ops II.\"The big question is whether Microsoft can maintain the momentum of its first-day sales once gamers have an alternative. Plus, \"Call of Duty\" has a real advantage. Unlike \"Halo,\" which is only available on Microsoft\'s Xbox console, \"Call of Duty\" is also available on Sony\'s PlayStation 3 and Nintendo\'s Wii U.Microsoft said that \"Halo 4\" puts the franchises\' total sales at north of $3.38 billion. And the company hit some new milestones in terms of the number of players��nearly four million people played the game in the first five days, with users spending a total of 31.4 hours playing the game. Another stat: Microsoft said online content for the live action digital series, \"Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn,\" has generated more than 46 million views so far.The stakes are high for Microsoft. The game cost an estimated $40 million to produce, which is more than twice the industry average. And this is Microsoft\'s premier video game property. Before last week\'s launch more than 46 million games had sold, spawning branded products like action figures and books.The game got off to a very strong start.

Not so fast. The odds of you accidentally owning a game worth anywhere over $1,000 are obscenely low. The world\'s most expensive games are either decades-old esoterica, little-known relics from the NES or Atari 2600 era that were created in extremely limited quantities, or bizarre import titles that you\'ve probably never even heard of.But what about more modest -- and far more common -- finds? It turns out there\'s a handful of relatively well-known games from the last few generations of consoles that fetch surprisingly high prices on the enthusiast market. Here\'s a few that you may actually own:Halo Triple Pack (Xbox)Price range: $80 - $150Halo 4 might be on everyone\'s mind right now, but this old compilation could be substantially more valuable.Bundling together Halo 1, Halo 2 and Halo 2\'s multiplayer map pack, the Halo Triple Pack was released for the original Xbox. Its high price -- about $80 upwards, for a used example -- reflects the fact that both games will play just fine on backwards-compatible Xbox 360s, keeping the triple pack in demand from new Halo fans who want to see where the story started.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Baldur\'s Gate: Dark Alliance II (PS2/Xbox)Price range: $25 - $100The second in a terrific hack \'n\' slash console series based on the even better PC Baldur\'s Gate franchise, Dark Alliance II retains a surprisingly high value on both PS2 and Xbox.Pristine copies can be worth as much as $100. Two main reasons underlie its continued popularity: it had a fairly small initial print run, and its co-operative, Diablo-style gameplay still holds up today.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence: Limited Edition (PS2)Price range: $100 - $500Are you the kind of gamer who likes to snag collector\'s editions versions of popular games? If you picked up this particular version of Metal Gear Solid 3, your extravagance could well pay off for once.It includes a DVD containing the game\'s cut-scenes edited into a three-and-a-half hour movie and remains hugely popular with the many fans of the series. New versions fetch a good $500, while used ones go for more like $100. Still, not bad for a six-year-old game.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Final Fantasy VII �� Black Label (Playstation)Price range: $50 - $500Classic role-playing game Final Fantasy VII is the polar opposite of rare. In fact, it was one of the best-selling games on the original Playstation, moving over 10 million copies around the world.But it remains in high demand: even used copies can fetch decent funds, while mint-condition, unopened examples of the original \'Black Label\' release (rather than the green \'Greatest Hits\' re-release) can be worth hundreds. Bet you wish you\'d never played yours, eh?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together (Playstation)Price range: $50 - $300Weird name, awesome game -- and even more awesome treasure.Originally released on the Super Nintendo, the Playstation port of the tactical role-playing game Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together (fun fact: the title is an homage to the rock band Queen) is highly sought after by fans of this superb series. Used copies routinely sell for around $50, and new ones run well into the $300 range.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning -- Collector\'s Edition (Xbox 360)Price range: $500 - $1,000It was the game that killed baseball star Curt Schilling\'s game development studio, but if you landed a copy of the collector\'s edition of 2012 RPG Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, it could be your ticket to a fortune. A small fortune, admittedly, but more than you\'d think.Bundled with a limited edition troll statue, signed lithographs, and assorted other goodies, the scarcity of this curio (only 700 were created) pushes its value as high as a thousand dollars, depending on condition.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Steel Battalion (Xbox)Price range: $100- $700Shipping with a vast, 40-button custom controller, this mech combat game was a slow seller at its 2002 release. With a price tag of $200, tepid reviews, and gameplay that was decidedly niche, it\'s hardly surprising.But if you were one of the few to take the plunge, you\'re onto a nice little earner. Even a well-used example will fetch a couple hundred over its original asking price, and unopened, intact games will bring in substantially more.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gamecube component cablesPrice range: $100 - $150Wait, what? Yes, believe it or not, component video cables for a Gamecube are worth a surprising amount of money. They were only ever made by Nintendo (no third-party alternatives exist) and in small quantities, and they\'re the only way to get high-quality video out of a Gamecube. So enthusiasts are prepared to pay considerable sums to get their hands on a set, often to the tune of well over $100.","url"=>"","source"=>""),

(It\'s worth noting that no user financial data was reported taken during the attack.)The firm alleges that Battle.Net authenticators, which Blizzard sells to add a layer of security onto the online system, are a \"deceptive upselling.\" They further accuse the maker of World of Warcraft and Diablo III of failing to maintain proper security protocols on the user information it stores.\"Blizzard should not be passing the costs of basic account security on to consumers after selling them these games,\" the firm said in a press release. \"They need to be honest if they\'re going to saddle people with additional costs. They need to be up front about the level of protection they will provide to their customers, and they cannot be negligent in maintaining proper security protocols.\"Blizzard responded in a statement to Forbes, calling the suit \"without merit and filled with patently false information\" and saying it \"will vigorously defend [itself] through the appropriate legal channels.\"Among other things, the suit is asking for damages, and that Blizzard no longer be allowed to force players to create Battle.net accounts to play its non-MMORPG titles, such as Starcraft and Diablo III.Blizzard\'s user database is a substantial one. World of Warcraft alone has 9.1 million active accounts, and at least another 4 million players likely still have log-in accounts. An unknown number of other accounts were also likely affected for players of the company\'s other games.Blizzard is one of many game companies who have been hit by hackers in the past year.

She loves the sailing, he says, as well as the scary birds and remembering to be brave.But since Link is always shown as a male in the game\'s text, her dad (who reads the words on the screen aloud) has had to remember to change all the male references to female on the fly so his daughter didn\'t feel like she wasn\'t part of the story.\"You can pick your character\'s name, of course��I always stick with Link, being a traditionalist��but all of the dialog insists that Link is a boy, and there\'s apparently nothing to be done about it,\" he noted on his blog. \"Well, there wasn\'t anything to be done about it, certainly not anything easy, but as you might imagine I\'m not having my daughter growing up thinking girls don\'t get to be the hero and rescue their little brothers.\"To fix this, Hoye used an emulator program and dove into the game\'s code, changing all gender-specific words. \"My lad\" and \"master\" became \"milady,\" though space restrictions in the code limited his choices.When he\'s not busy doing father-of-the-year type stuff, Hoye is the founder of Bespoke I/O, an enterprise software company based in Toronto.He\'s also something of a Zelda scholar, noting in another blog post the complexities of the game\'s sociopolitical background.\"Your role as a hero there is ostensibly to gain the powers and tools you need to defeat Ganon, noted evil megalomaniac, and secure the safety of the Kingdom of Hyrule,\" he writes. \"But if you look a little closer, your role there is explicitly to restore the status quo ante of the Kingdom of Hyrule, power structure and all.

				array("title"=>"5 big changes coming to Call of Duty: Black Ops II","description" => "Call of Duty: Black Ops II (Credit: Activision)Call of Duty is the biggest video game series in the world, but there\'s a fair chance you\'re suffering from a little franchise fatigue. And who can blame you? Activision has released a new Call of Duty game every year since 2005. That\'s a lot of war.But the games keep selling, and critics keep digging them, and we keep playing them, so it should have come as little shock that there would be a sequel to the 25 million-selling military monster, Call of Duty: Black Ops.What is a bit more surprising, however, is how much new flavor Call of Duty: Black Ops II (releasing November 13 for the Xbox 360, PS3 and PC and November 18 for the Wii U) adds to the franchise\'s time-tested formula. Stay frosty and check out five of the biggest changes coming to what\'s bound to be the biggest game of 2012.It\'s a futurist.Sick of the same old war? Black Ops II forges new ground for fans by letting them trip through time between a Cold War past and the near future of 2025. It\'s a somewhat risky new direction for Call of Duty, which has thus far focused its stories on retelling past and present-day events.But the new scenario should breathe new life into the franchise, featuring a plot that grabs today\'s headlines and runs wild with them. You\'ll squabble with global superpower China over rare earth elements �� a current bone of contention for the U.S. -- while tinkering with all sorts of futuristic doodads like controllable quadcopters and robotic tanks.This isn\'t Halo, however. To ensure the plausibility of Black Ops II\'s future, the developers brought on technological warfare specialist Pete W. Singer, author of the critically-acclaimed \"Wired for War.\" It\'s a little bit science, a little bit fiction, and what sounds like a great deal of fun for gamers.[Related: Watch the Call of Duty: Black Ops II Launch Trailer]It puts the story in your hands.When most people think of a Call of Duty single-player campaign, they think of a tightly-scripted rollercoaster ride pulled straight out of Michael Bay\'s Big Action Playbook. It\'s essentially a linear, playable movie. But Black Ops II is a different sort of beast, giving the story back to the players by featuring a branching storyline, a first for the franchise.\"Players will come to points where there\'s a decision to make, and those  decisions will affect the narrative arc of their characters, of other characters, of the entire story,\" Mark Lamia, head of developer Treyarch Studios, told Yahoo! Games.Also influencing the outcome are brand new \'Strike Force\' missions: optional, sandbox style levels woven into the main story that gamers can play through in a variety of ways, including an \'Overwatch\' strategy mode that lets them control units from on high. A genuinely non-linear Call of Duty, believe it or not -- and like any good labyrinthine tale, Black Ops II won\'t end the same way for everyone.\"These decision points are meaningful to not only the game they\'re playing, but the ending,\" says Lamia. \"There are multiple endings based on these branching story points.\"It\'s got zombies. Lots of \'em.You can\'t leave the house without running into a zombie horde or two these days. And while Call of Duty\'s been dealing with zombies since 2008\'s World at War, the undead play a much more prominent role in Black Ops II.\"It\'s bigger and more expansive than any zombies experience we\'ve ever created,\" Lamia says.Four game modes await those looking to mow down some shamblers, including the new open-world Tranzit game type, which lets players roam around a collection of maps in a rickety bus. Along the way they\'ll pick up buildable items and weapons to improve their chances of survival. Add to that a classic Survival mode and a quirky Grief mode (in which teams sabotage one another as they try to survive against the encroaching hordes) and you\'ve got what essentially amounts to another full video game.A league of your own.Solo campaigns and zombie epidemics are all well and good, but a good chunk of gamers will skip all that nonsense and hop online for the game\'s famed multiplayer. Even here, Black Ops II breaks from tradition.For starters, the game introduces League Play, a matchmaking system that levels the playing field and ensures you\'re always competing with people of a similar skill level, answering a common gripe levied by those who can\'t seem to succeed against superior competition.\"When we say \"esports\" people automatically think about pros, but it\'s really about competition,\" Lamia says. \"Even if you\'re a beginner or just an average player, there\'s going to be a league you can be competitive in.\"You\'ll get placed in a league after playing through a few test matches. Should you get better �� and if you play enough, you most certainly will �� you\'ll get bumped into a new league.Other new features aim to turn Black Ops II into a sort of Monday Night Football for first-person shooter fans. There\'s CODcasting, for instance, a set of broadcasting tools that lets anyone \'televise\' a match by using multiple camera angles and calling the shots via play-by-play analysis. And in another first for pro gaming, you can even livestream Xbox 360 and PS3 matches directly to Youtube without any extra hardware.Play your way.Playing Call of Duty online encompasses a lot more than just aiming, shooting, and running for cover when you miss. Every match nets you some experience points, which in turn help you access new weapons, perks, items and more. Black Ops II lets you deal with all that stuff in a new way, however, thanks to the game\'s new class system.Prefer to have an extra scope? Want to bulk up on perks? The game\'s \'Pick 10\' create-a-class system frees players from the shackles of having one primary weapon, one secondary weapon, some grenades and a few perks. Bulk up on munitions and bail out on perks, if you wish, or go a little more sci-fi and go perk crazy while running around with a knife. Like much of Black Ops II, the choice is yours �� and that\'s just the way Lamia wants it.\"You can now modify classes in ways you could never do before in a Call of Duty game��there\'s just a mind-boggling amount of custom game options for players.\"","url"=>"","source"=>""),

Though the game doesn\'t feature the Osama bin Laden raid, it covers a variety of real-world hotspots and boasts that its missions are based on actual events.Punishment for the seven SEAL members includes letters of reprimand �� effectively ruining any chance at promotion �� and cut pay for two months.

Overall sales, which factor in hardware and accessories, were also down 25 percent.\"Skylanders Giants software performed well, breaking into the top 10 title ranking, and selling over 160 percent more units than last year\'s Skylanders title did in its debut month at retail, said NPD industry analyst, Liam Callahan.\"Unfortunately, other sequels new to market this month did not perform as well compared to prior iterations. This, combined with poor comps against the launch of hits like Battlefield 3 and Batman: Arkham City in October 2011, led to the decline in software sales.\"Performing particularly poorly was EA\'s Medal of Honor: Warfighter, which ranked just 8th. The game, which EA did not give to critics in advance, has been walloped by critics and user interest has been low.Mediocre reviews didn\'t hurt Resident Evil 6, though, which was the month\'s number two title. EA\'s failure to launch an NBA game gave 2K Sports a clear path to take the month\'s sales title with NBA 2K13, which outperformed last year\'s version by about 60%.

				array("title"=>"Grand Theft Auto V details revealed: Three protagonists, biggest GTA ever","description" => "(Credit: Rockstar Games/Game Informer)Video game crime is set to explode in 2013 thanks to the release of Grand Theft Auto V. And thanks to Game Informer, we finally have a few firm details about exactly what the game has in store. An 18-page cover story in the magazine\'s December issue reveals a wealth of info about the enigmatic open-world game, and it packs some doozies.For starters, you won\'t be playing as one character, you\'ll play as three: retired former bank robber Michael (also the narrator in the game\'s debut trailer), career criminal and \'loose cannon\' Trevor, and young street hustler Franklin. You\'ll even be able to swap between the three at will.It\'s set in Los Santos, the fictitious take on Los Angeles first covered in GTA: San Andreas. But it\'s significantly bigger than that game -- or any other Rockstar game, as it were. The world of GTA V is bigger than three previous Rockstar hits -- San Andreas, Red Dead Redemption, and GTA IV -- combined.The game will also feature more vehicles than any GTA game, extracurricular activities like jet skiing, golf and base-jumping (!), randomized street missions and a more functional in-game economy than what we got with GTA IV.It all sounds pretty magnificent, and the game industry could certainly use a Grand Theft Auto-sized boost. The franchise has sold over 110 million copies to date -- putting it in the all-time top 10 -- and EEDAR analyst Jesse Divnich believes the new game could sell as many as 25 million copies in its first year alone.You can get the full story �� it\'s a massive spread -- in the December issue of Game Informer, though it\'s already available digitally.","url"=>"","source"=>""),

The mash-up, on the surface, at least, has potential disaster written all over it.But like peanut butter and chocolate, it turns out this pop-culture odd couple works great together, and is certain to delight fans of both franchises. Available today for iOS, Android, Kindle Fire, and Windows and Mac computers, it could actually turn out to be the Angry Birds game you were looking for.Just don\'t let the weak beginning fool you. Angry Birds Star Wars starts off like a typical Angry Birds game��only the bird, in this case, has Luke Skywalker\'s 1970s haircut. And you might be tempted to think you\'ve seen all this before.It\'s not long, though, before Bird-versions of other familiar characters start to appear, which is where the game starts to stand out from its predecessors. R2D2 shocks enemies in addition to crashing into them. Obi Wan uses a Force push, which, in a brilliant geeky twist, gets stronger after Vader strikes him down. The Luke bird even becomes more interesting after a few levels with the addition of a lightsaber, which cuts down enemies and structures and lets him deflect laser blasts back at stormtrooper pigs.And Han? Star  Wars purists will be happy to know that he shoots first, both in his introductory scene and when he\'s used in the game (you can touch an enemy while he\'s in the air and he\'ll fire three rounds from his blaster at the enemy).","url"=>"","source"=>""),

The show includes local acts and is hosted by MTV EXIT, the music channel\'s initiative to raise awareness about human trafficking and exploitation.\"That\'s pretty exciting,\" Mraz said of the history involved, \"and I\'m going there with an enormous amount of gratitude and respect, and I hope we can actually make a difference. I hope it\'s also a testament to the songs. I\'ve always wanted my songs to be about healing and self-empowerment, and if this is the way MTV is acknowledging that, then I am incredibly grateful.\"The show, which will include local acts, will be broadcast on Myanmar national television and will air on MTV\'s international network in 2013. Mraz hosted a similar concert in the Philippines last year. He first became interested in the issue about four years ago when he attended the Freedom Awards, an annual salute to those working against human exploitation, put on by the organization Free the Slaves.\"I thought this was something that was abolished when Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, but all it did is become hidden from our view,\" Mraz said in a phone interview from Zurich, Switzerland. \"There was a recent estimate that there are about 27 million people enslaved on the planet, certainly due to hard economic times not just in the Western world, but certainly in Third World countries.

The concert offers an opportunity to \"educate, empower and engage.\" The 35-year-old singer says he plans to tailor his show to the message.\"I do curate a set list that I feel is going to be part of that educate, empower and engage (theme),\" he said. \"Obviously songs like \'I\'m Yours,\' \'I Won\'t Give Up\' are great examples.

(AP) -- Bernard Lansky, the Memphis retailer who helped a young Elvis Presley establish his signature clothing style of pegged pants, two-toned shoes and other flashy duds in the 1950s, has died. He was 85.Julie Lansky, the clothier\'s granddaughter, said he died Thursday at his Memphis home.Bing: Elvis\' styleLansky started his retail business in Memphis in 1946 with a $125 loan from his father, Samuel.After World War II, the store started selling Army surplus goods on Beale Street. When the supply dried up, he opened a high-fashion men\'s store, where he established his reputation as a natural salesman and storyteller.Lansky Bros. ended up supplying Presley with the pink and black shirts and other outfits.\"It\'s a statement to say that he dressed one of the most influential entertainers of all time,\" Julie Lansky said in a telephone interview. \"He knew that for any entertainer, they had to look different.\"Even though his style of dress changed over the years, which at one point included sparkling jumpsuits, Presley shopped at Lansky Bros. the rest of his life. Presley died at his Memphis residence, Graceland, in 1977.Lansky picked out the white suit and blue tie that Presley wore when he was buried.\"I put his first suit on him and his last suit on him,\" Lansky was fond of saying.By the early 1950s, Lansky\'s shop was known as a place where a man with a taste for flash could find the styles Lansky referred to as \"real sharp.\"At the time, Beale Street was a hot spot for blues, rhythm and blues, and jazz, and drew a colorful parade of musicians, gamblers and hustlers from the Mississippi Delta.Presley began hanging around Beale Street as a teenager and picked up quickly on its music.One of Lansky\'s favorite Elvis stories was how he first met the future King of Rock \'n\' Roll. Presley was a teenager working as an usher at a nearby theater and liked to window shop at Lansky\'s.\"He said, \'When I get rich, I\'m going to buy you out,\'\" Lansky said in a standard version of the story. \"I said, \'Don\'t buy me out. Just buy from me.\' And he never forgot me.\"Presley made his first record, \"That\'s All Right,\" at the old Sun Studio in 1954. Before long, Presley\'s star was rising, and he began shopping at Lansky Bros. in earnest.Although the Lansky brothers ran the store together, Bernard insisted on waiting on Presley personally. He eventually bought out brother Guy.Lansky often opened the store at night so Presley could avoid drawing crowds and took outfits to Graceland for him to check out.Lansky dressed him for the \"Louisiana Hayride\" and his first TV spots on the Tommy Dorsey and Ed Sullivan shows.Eventually, Lansky became a favorite of the Elvis faithful, who flocked to Memphis by the thousands for annual gatherings in Presley\'s honor.Lansky Bros. kept drawing the fans even after moving in 1981 from the Beale Street entertainment district to the Peabody Hotel, a downtown Memphis landmark a few blocks away.\"We get them from all over the world. The first thing when they get here, they\'ve got to come down to Lansky\'s,\" Lansky said.Fans weren\'t his only visitors. Entertainers like B.B. King, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, ZZ Top, Kiss, and Hootie and the Blowfish also dropped by to shop and visit.In 1997, the Presley estate opened a nightclub called Elvis Presley\'s Memphis at Lansky\'s old store on Beale Street. It closed in 2003, and the building was left unused once again.Lansky and son Hal came out with a line of 1950s-style clothes in 2001, and one of their four shops in the Peabody was called \"Lansky 126,\" the street number of the old Beale Street store. All four shops are open to this day.Lansky continued working past the age that most people retire.\"What am I going to retire for? What am I going to do?\" he said at age 77, in June 2004. \"I get here every morning at 6 o\'clock, seven days a week.\"","url"=>"","source"=>""),

The judge put the case on hold until the appeal is resolved.Rubinson\'s ruling only affects Raef\'s case, but the law could be struck down completely by the appellate court, said Brad Kaiserman, an attorney for Raef.Kaiserman argued the statute was unconstitutional and meant to protect celebrities, not the public.\"This discrimination sets a dangerous precedent,\" he said.Prosecutors countered that the law could be applied to people in other professions, not just the media.\"The focus is not the photo. The focus is on the driving,\" Rosenthal argued.While the media is granted freedom under the First Amendment, its latitude to gather news is not unlimited, she said.\"This activity has been found to be particularly dangerous,\" she said of chases involving paparazzi.Prosecutors should focus on using existing laws, including reckless driving and false imprisonment statutes, to tackle aggressive behavior by celebrity photographers, said Doug Mirell, a First Amendment attorney.\"I think that celebrities who are being stalked or chased by paparazzi are entitled to be concerned about their personal safety and the safety of their families when these events occur,\" Mirell said. \"But I think that there\'s a legitimate question about whether the Legislature took the right path in trying to accommodate those concerns.\"He said the judge\'s concerns about having other members of the public caught up in the case is valid, and any law that specifically targets newsgathering efforts will prove more difficult to win than a case filed using traditional laws.The law used to charge Raef was influenced by the experiences of Jennifer Aniston, who provided details to a lawmaker on being unable to drive away after she was surrounded by paparazzi on Pacific Coast Highway.","url"=>"","source"=>""),

				array("title"=>"A Method to Cut Biofuel Costs","description" => "Cellulosic ethanol, which is produced from the inedible fibers in plant and crop residues, fast-growing grasses and woodchips, has often been hailed as the holy grail of biofuels. It��s made from low-cost and plentiful feedstocks; it has the potential to be widely produced yet doesn��t pit food against fuel, as accused in corn-based ethanol production; and it has a smaller carbon footprint than either petroleum or ethanol from corn.There��s just one catch: cost. While the feedstocks are cheap, the process of turning them into useful chemicals and fuels isn��t. With a high cost per gallon to convert the tough plant fibers into fermentable sugars, large-scale production has so far proved too pricey to be competitive in the marketplace. That outlook might soon change, however, thanks to a discovery by scientists at Ames Laboratory that could remove one of the biggest cost barriers to commercialization.Javier Vela, an Ames chemist, has found a way to make photocatalyst nanoparticles that are more stable and require only sunlight to carry out the key fiber-to-sugar conversion�� developments that could reduce costs of catalyst replacement while eliminating the need for expensive external energy inputs.��The main way people covert biomass into fuels or chemicals is by thermolysis or heating,�� said Vela, who is also an assistant professor of chemistry at Iowa State University. ��It��s very energy-intensive, as you start by wasting a lot of energy just to break all these big plant cell molecules apart. If you can get rid of that heating step, you��re already making the process more efficient.��With Vela��s new solar energy-harvesting photocatalyst, the heating step may no longer be needed. He��s discovered a way to use nanoparticles made from naturally strong light absorbers. He and graduate student Purnima Ruberu created a photocatalyst capable of absorbing even more light��importantly, in the desired red to near-infra-red spectrum for solar energy��and powering a chemical reaction based only on the sun��s energy.��For the most part, these sunlight photochemical reactions with biomass substrates have not really been explored,�� Vela said. ��But if you think about it, the best photocatalyst is actually nature��so, leaves and photosynthesis.��In an effort to more closely mimic how plants create energy through photosynthesis, where chloroplasts in plant cells use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into sugars that feed them, Vela is working with colleagues at Ames Lab on encapsulating these light-harvesting rods inside transparent porous supports.These supports contain the rods while still allowing light infiltration and exchange with the outside medium. And because they are largely insoluble, they can be more easily collected and reused.��The porous supports are the synthetic equivalent of a chloroplast,�� Vela said. ��By putting our photocatalyst in them, we hope to control how fast those reactions occur��so that instead of getting two or 10 percent energy conversion, we get 100 percent conversion.��As with many important discoveries, Vela��s happened by accident. He originally wanted to create a rod-shaped photocatalyst made of just cadmium and selenium��elements that together absorb light strongly in the preferred region of the solar spectrum. But due to certain properties of those elements, the process of making rods frequently produced other shapes not as conducive for solar energy harvesting.He had recently learned, however, about a simple and reproducible process of making rods from cadmium mixed with sulfur. While those elements have a bluer band gap, Vela surmised that following the procedure for making cadmium-sulfur nanorods, but adding small amounts of selenium,  would achieve the desired shape, while skewing the final mixture into a redder band gap range.He was right about the redder band gap, but the resulting shape��drumstick-like particles with thick ��heads�� and narrow ��tails����seemed to run counter to the laws of chemistry.��Usually when you mix two or more semiconducting materials together, the optical properties tend to be an average of the pure materials,�� Vela said. ��The shape we got just didn��t make sense. According to solid-state chemistry, you should be able to make a solid solution of, in this case cadmium-sulfide and cadmium-selenide, where you have a homogenous distribution of sulfur and selenium across the rod structure. Instead what we got was a head region very rich in selenium and another area that��s very thin and rich in sulfur. We didn��t understand at first why there was that segregation of materials.��Further investigation revealed a simple explanation: The sulfur and selenium precursors Vela used had mismatched reactivities, which caused them to form at different times resulting in the drumstick shape. While he didn��t unearth some new law of nature, stumbling on a way to segregate elements in a solid-state mixture proved key to discovering how to make the cadmium-sulfur-selenium photocatalyst more stable across multiple uses.��In our photocatalyst design, we need a second particle��a metal island, or co-catalyst,�� Vela said. ��Once you form that electron-hole pair, you need to separate those charges, and it��s the metal island that does that. We never would have been able to figure out how to do that without having made those drumstick structures with two different poles.��This metal island is what bestows enhanced longevity on Vela��s photocatalyst. The ones lacking the metal island completely dissolved after eight days, while he said that those with it remained active. Currently, the enhanced photocatalysts survive about two weeks, a considerable boost in recyclability. Extending that durability even more is merely a matter of optimizing, he said, not functionality.��We��ve shown that the photocatalyst works��that the reaction really works, at room temperature, driven just by sunlight,�� Vela said. ��I��m sure it can be optimized.��Currently, Vela and colleagues are working to perfect the method for encapsulating the rods within porous networks and he��s optimistic about where the work is heading, and what it could mean for the future of biofuels processing. Another promising aspect of his research is its transferability to other materials��a fact that would be particularly important if ever questions were raised about cadmium toxicity.This technology is available for license.

That wall makes it very difficult to get drugs into the bacterium.The researchers used X-ray crystallography (including X-ray beams produced by the Advanced Photon Source) to study the Rv3066 structure. They collected data showing the regulator when the toxic compound ethidium bromide was present and when it was not.The data revealed an asymmetric, two-part molecule with a spiral structure. The structure is flexible, allowing the regulator to recognize and respond to multiple drugs. In the presence of ethidium, Yu��s group says the regulator responds with a rotational motion, inducing expression of the efflux pump that rids the bacterium of antimicrobial drugs.Studying that structure and mechanism could make a difference in the fight against drug-resistant tuberculosis: ��Elucidating the regulatory systems of multidrug efflux pumps in M. tuberculosis,�� Yu and the researchers wrote in their paper, ��should allow us to understand how this bacterium contributes to multidrug resistance and how it adapts to environmental changes.��","url"=>"","source"=>""),

				array("title"=>"Ames Laboratory scientists crack long-standing chemistry mystery","description" => "Andreja Bakac, Chemical and Biological Sciences, 515-294-3544Laura Millsaps, Public Affairs, 515-294-3474A team of researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy\'s Ames Laboratory has answered a key question concerning the widely-used Fenton reaction �C important in wastewater treatment to destroy hazardous organic chemicals and decontaminate bacterial pathogens and in industrial chemical production.   The naturally occurring reaction was first discovered in 1894 by H.J.H. Fenton, a British chemist at Cambridge, and involves hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and iron.How the Fenton reaction actually happens has remained in contention. Scientists have long debated whether it was a hydroxyl (OH) radical or a form of iron known as the ferryl ion, [Fe(IV)O]2+, that functioned as the reaction intermediate for the Fenton reaction, with data to support both theories.Now, Andreja Bakac and Oleg Pestovsky, scientists at Ames Laboratory in the Division of Chemical and Biological Sciences, and chemistry graduate student Hajem Bataineh, have proved that the reaction can take different paths depending on the pH of the reaction environment. In an acidic environment, the intermediate is an OH radical; at neutral pH, the intermediate is the ferryl ion.��This is enormous when you think about all the work that went into trying to solve this issue when the acidity of the solution was not considered as a parameter. It certainly varied from one work to the next, and may explain the confusion that grew out of contradicting results in the literature,�� said Bakac.So, is the reaction fundamental? Yes. Simple? No. The exact nature of the mechanism of the Fenton reaction has eluded science for decades, and has been all that time a subject of close inquiry��and debate.��The reaction takes place between iron which is widespread on Earth, and hydrogen peroxide which is derived from oxygen and also present almost everywhere on this planet.  You know you are facing a real challenge when the reaction between two very common compounds has not been fully explained in a hundred years, despite all the efforts,�� said Bakac.Over those past hundred years, the Fenton intermediates were reduced to two, the hydroxyl radical or the ferryl ion.Much was known already about hydroxyl radicals.  However, it wasn��t until 2005 that Bakac��s research group, in collaboration with groups at Carnegie Mellon and University of Minnesota, was able to directly characterize the ferryl ion and study its reactions. This gave them the ability to compare the two potential intermediates.��We found that these two species, in many of the reactions, behave pretty much the same, which would make it very difficult to distinguish between them,�� explained Bakac of the earlier research.  \"The breakthrough came with some unique reactions that one intermediate will do and the other one will not, or where the products were different, and that gave us the key.��We were thrilled to obtain a clear and unambiguous answer.  The intermediate was the OH radical, and not the ferryl ion.  We published the paper, we had a write up in Chemical and Engineering News; this was very exciting.��But the question still didn��t seem settled. Other scientists continued to assert that ferryl was the intermediate.��We thought how can this be?  We just proved that it isn��t.  There were also some theoretical papers that came out at the time, also supporting the ferryl ion.��The continued debate prompted Bakac and her research partners to look at the potential effect of reaction conditions, specifically the acidity of the solution. That led to the discovery that either intermediate can be involved, depending on the pH of the reaction environment.The discovery not only solves a long-running debate in academic chemistry, it opens up possibilities for new ways to use the reaction.��If we can understand fully what��s going on, then we can take advantage of that understanding and develop new uses for the Fenton reaction,�� said Bakac.The discovery could lead to catalytic reactions using widely available iron in neutral conditions, and environmentally friendlier processes in everything from wastewater treatment to industrial oxidations.��It becomes not just a better understood reaction, but a more useful one from a practical standpoint,�� said Bakac.The findings were published in the journal Chemical Science and co-authored by Bakac, Pestovsky and Bataineh.The research is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy��s Office of Science.

But it is in an area with a less glitzy aura-plant sciences-where nanotechnology advancements are contributing dramatically to agriculture.Researchers at Iowa State University have now demonstrated the ability to deliver proteins and DNA into plant cells, simultaneously. This is important because it now opens up opportunities for more sophisticated and targeted plant genome editing-techniques that require the precise delivery of both protein and DNA to bring about specific gene modifications in crop plants. Such modifications are becoming more and more important in the face of our changing climates as new insect pests, plant diseases and soil stresses emerge where previously there were few.While DNA delivery into cells has become routine, delivering proteins and enzymes to both animal and plant cells has proved more challenging. The Iowa State team\'s protein delivery advancement is an important achievement toward this end.A research paper describing the advancement has been published online by the journal Advanced Functional Materials. The work was partially sponsored by Pioneer Hi-Bred with long-term support from Iowa State University\'s Plant Sciences Institute.The Iowa State research team includes Kan Wang, professor of agronomy; Brian Trewyn, associate scientist in chemistry; Susana Martin-Ortigosa, a post-doctoral research associate in agronomy; and Justin Valenstein, a chemistry doctoral student.Nanoparticles are tiny materials that are the size equivalent of several molecules sitting side-by-side or the size of a big virus. A single nanometer is one-billionth of a meter. The virus that causes AIDS is roughly 100 nanometers in diameter.Using new and improved custom-built honeycomb-like mesoporous silica nanoparticles that the Iowa State team designed five years ago, the researchers have demonstrated co-delivery of functional protein and DNA into plant cells.The first generation of these customized particles were relatively small (100 nanometers) and so the available packing spaces were unable to accommodate larger functional molecules such as proteins or enzymes. This next generation is five times the size (500 nanometers) and looks something like an ultra-fine piece of Honeycomb cereal.The key to the researchers\' success is a newly devised method for making larger uniform pouches in the custom nanoparticles. An additional modification-gold plating the entire silica particle prior to packing-improved DNA and protein binding for a more secure payload.To test the new particle\'s effectiveness, Wang and her colleagues loaded the pores with a green florescent protein derived from jelly fish, which serves as a photo marker inside the plant cell. Next, these particles were coated with DNA encoding a red protein from coral. The complex was then shot into plant cells using a gene gun, a traditional gene delivery method that gets foreign material past the plant\'s protective cell wall.The gold plating innovation added some greatly needed ballistic heft to the particles, ensuring their ability to cannonball through the plant cell wall once released from the gene gun.Cells that fluoresce both red and green at the same time confirm successful delivery. The team has demonstrated success in onion, tobacco and maize cells.The work is a tangible realization of efforts the team had in the design stage just two years ago when colleague Victor Lin of Iowa State University and the U.S. Department of Energy\'s Ames Laboratory unexpectedly died. \"He was such a brilliant scientist,\" says Wang. \"We all felt completely lost when we lost him.\"But the team pulled together, capitalizing on the excellent training all had received from working with Lin to make this next generation particle a reality.\"We would have been unable to work out anything without each other,\" says Wang. \"This success proves his legacy continues.\"","url"=>"","source"=>""),

Keith Woo is searching for cleaner, greener chemical reactions.Woo, an Iowa State University professor of chemistry and an associate of the U.S. Department of Energy\'s Ames Laboratory, has studied catalysts and the chemical reactions they affect for more than 25 years. And these days, his focus is on green catalysis.That, he said, is the search for catalysts that lead to more efficient chemical reactions. That could mean they promote reactions at lower pressures and temperatures. Or it could mean they promote reactions that create less waste. Or it could mean finding safer, cleaner alternatives to toxic or hazardous conditions, such as using water in place of organic solvents.\"We\'re trying to design, discover and optimize materials that will produce chemical reactions in a way that the energy barrier is lowered,\" Woo said. \"We\'re doing fundamental, basic catalytic work.\"And much of that work is inspired by biology.In one project, Woo and his research group are studying how iron porphyrins (the heme in the hemoglobin of red blood cells) can be used for various catalytic applications. Iron porphyrins are the active sites in a variety of the enzymes that create reactions and processes within a cell. Most of the iron porphyrin reactions involve oxidation and electron transfer reactions.Because the iron porphyrins of biology have evolved into highly specialized catalysts, Woo and his research group are studying how they can be used synthetically with the goal of developing catalysts that influence a broader range of reactions.\"We\'ve found porphyrins are capable of doing many reactions - often as well, or better, or cheaper than other catalysts,\" Woo said.Another project is using combinatorial techniques to accelerate the development, production and optimization of catalysts. Woo and his research group are using molecular biology to quickly screen a massive library of DNA molecules for catalyst identification and development. The goal is to create water-soluble catalysts for organic reactions.\"Combinatorial approaches such as these have been applied to drug design, but their use in transition metal catalyst development is in its infancy,\" Woo wrote in a summary of the project.A third project is looking for catalysts that allow greener production of lactams, which are compounds used in the production of solvents, nylons and other polymers. Commercial lactam production traditionally uses harsh reagents and conditions, such as sulfuric acid and high temperatures, and also creates significant wastes.Woo, in collaboration with Robert Angelici, a Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Chemistry, has found a gold-based catalyst that eliminates the need for the acid and high pressure and also eliminates the wastes. The Iowa State Research Foundation Inc. is seeking a patent on the technology.And, in a fourth project, Woo is working to understand the chemistry behind the chemical reactions that create bio-oil from the fast pyrolysis of biomass. Fast pyrolysis quickly heats biomass (such as corn stalks and leaves) in the absence of oxygen to produce a liquid bio-oil that can be used to manufacture fuels and chemicals.Woo\'s projects are supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of Energy, Iowa State\'s Institute for Physical Research and Technology, Iowa State\'s Bioeconomy Institute, and the National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Biorenewable Chemicals based at Iowa State. Woo\'s research team includes post-doctoral researcher Wenya Lu and doctoral students B.J. Anding, Taiwo Dairo, Erik Klobukowski and Gina Roberts.Sit down with Woo and he\'ll call up slide after slide of the chemical equations that describe chemical reactions.And before long he\'s describing how catalysts are discovered these days.\"The traditional way to develop catalysts was very Edisonian - one experiment at a time,\" Woo said. \"It was all by trial and error.\"Now, with high-throughput approaches, Woo said his research group is able to quickly test a reaction using one hundred trillion different catalysts.And that, Woo said, is \"helping us find less expensive and more environmentally friendly materials and conditions to perform these catalytic reactions.\"","url"=>"","source"=>""),

They\'re also looking for ways to synthesize the polymers without the use of harsh acids and temperatures by making them soluble in organic solvents.The building blocks of their work are a variety of benzobisazoles, molecules well suited for electrical applications because they efficiently transport electrons, are stable at high temperatures and can absorb photons.And if the polymers are lacking in any of those properties, Jeffries-EL and her research group can do some chemical restructuring.\"With these polymers, if you don\'t have the properties you need, you can go back and change the wheel,\" Jeffries-EL said. \"You can change the chemical synthesis and produce what\'s missing.\"That, she said, doesn\'t work with silicon and other inorganic materials for semiconductors: \"Silicon is silicon.

A research team led by Yu - an Iowa State associate professor of physics and astronomy, of chemistry, of biochemistry, biophysics and molecular biology and an associate of the U.S. Department of Energy\'s Ames Laboratory - is working to discover the assembled structure of the entire three-part efflux pump.Yu said a better understanding of how the three parts work together could help medical researchers find ways to restore the effectiveness of antibiotics.\"These pumps have to assemble together in order to pump out heavy metals and antibiotics,\" Yu said. \"Researchers may be able to use these findings to design an inhibitor so the pump can\'t be assembled and can\'t work.\"Yu and his research team described the first part of the pump - the inner membrane transporter known as CusA - in the Sept. 23, 2010, issue of the journal Nature.The current paper describes the inner membrane transporter and how it interacts with the pump\'s middle adapter, known as CusB.

Then they used X-ray crystallography, including a technique called molecular replacement with single-wavelength anomalous dispersion, to determine the structure and interaction of the two parts.The studies revealed, molecule by molecule, how the inner transporter\'s three molecules bind and interact with the middle adaptor\'s six molecules. The studies also revealed the adaptors\' six molecules form a funnel-like channel extending from the top of the transporter.The researchers used those discoveries to predict how the three-molecule structure of the pump\'s third part, the outer membrane channel known as CusC, interacts with the CusBA complex.Yu said discovering the structure of the toxin pump is a significant step toward a better understanding of bacterial resistance to antibiotics.\"A crystallographic model of this tripartite efflux complex has been unavailable,\" the researchers wrote in a summary of their latest Nature paper, \"simply because co-crystallization of different components of the system has proven to be extremely difficult.\"","url"=>"","source"=>""),
				array("title"=>"Researchers study flu proteins in-depth to identify virus vulnerabilities","description" => "Each year, people everywhere prepare for flu season. Some will get the flu vaccine, some take vitamin supplements, some launch a vigorous handwashing campaign, while others take an entirely different approach: nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).Mei Hong, a chemist at Iowa State University, uses NMR to study a proton channel named M2, found on the surface of the influenza virus. This proton channel has been the subject of numerous studies because of the key role it plays in helping a virus take over a healthy cell after it gets inside.In order to infect a healthy cell, a flu virus must enter the cell and empty viral genes into it. First, the virus binds to the cell. Then it becomes enveloped inside a bubble called an endosome as it gets taken into the cell. It is acidic inside the endosome--more acidic than the interior of the virus it contains. This pH difference serves as a signal to the virus that it is inside the cell, so it is time to release the viral genes. It is the M2 proton channel that helps the virus sense this difference in acidity and trigger the release of viral genes into the cell. Since the cell cannot tell the difference between its own genes and those of the virus, it gets tricked into making copies of the virus which can eventually go on to infect other cells.Another great unknownWe know quite a bit about how a virus can infect a cell, but until recently it was still unclear exactly how the protons move from the endosome into the virus to trigger infection. Scientists suggested two distinct possibilities: the first, a \"shutter\" model in which the channel is either \"open\" or \"closed\" to the flow of water that carries an extra proton into the virus, or a \"shuttle\" model, in which the components of the channel actually move to relay protons from the exterior to the interior of the virus.\"Computational methods for predicting these structures are not good enough yet, so experimentally determining the high resolution structure of the histidine portion of this molecule, which controls the proton relay, is very important. Fortunately we had a vast knowledge of this protein that allowed us to zoom in on the histidine residue precisely,\" said Hong.The role of NMRBut what is NMR, and how do researchers use it? NMR is actually a property of the nucleus of an atom when it interacts with a magnetic field. What that means is that NMR is a property of matter, like color or density or mass. Scientists have found ways to turn this property into useful information, especially in the field of imaging. For example, physicians use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines to see inside a patient without surgery. These machines use NMR to create a detailed visualization of tissues in the body. Scientists can use NMR in the same way on a really magnified scale to look inside much smaller things like an individual protein, or even just a part of a protein.\"One can study the structure of proteins in many ways, but protons are difficult to visualize by X-rays,\" said Hong. X-rays are commonly used to study the structure of proteins in a crystal form. \"We used NMR because we wanted to see where the protons are relative to the channel. Moreover, the state of the samples that we study using NMR is closer to the natural biological state than most other structure determination techniques.\"Shuttling throughUsing NMR, Hong\'s team was able to obtain evidence that the channel moves protons by the \"shuttle\" model. The work, published in the October 22, 2010 issue of the journal Science, shows that ring-shaped histidine molecules facing the pore of the channel are able to flip back and forth at more than 50,000 times per second when the channel is in an open state (imagine a windshield wiper-like motion).After every few flips, the histidine is able to pick up a proton from outside the virus and flip it into the interior of the virus. Movement of protons into the virus causes the interior to become more acidic as protons accumulate. This serves as a signal that the virus is inside the cell, and it should release its genes--the next step in the viral infection process.It\'s a shuttle. So what?Knowing which model is the right one is actually pretty important, because there are drugs that can block this step in the process of viral infection. Amantadine and rimantadine, respectively known by the trade names Symmetrel and Flumadine, are two of the older antiviral drugs approved by the FDA. Both have been shown to make flu symptoms less severe and shorten the time it takes to get better.Hong has also used NMR to learn more about amantadine, which prevents susceptible viruses from spreading. The study, included in Nature on February 4, 2010, showed that amantadine binds two different sites on the M2 protein. Combined with other data, Hong and colleagues concluded that amantadine physically blocks the M2 channel, preventing the movement of protons into the virus and subsequently, reproduction and spread of the virus.Unfortunately, amantadine and rimantadine are no longer recommended for widespread use because many flu strains, including H1N1, are resistant.Bring on the mutantsNow that scientists have a better understanding of how the M2 channel moves protons and where amantadine binds in the M2 channel, they want to use the same techniques to study how the M2 channel is different in drug-resistant versions of the virus.Hong explained, \"Since most flu viruses now have the mutation, we will focus on that next.\"Results from the Nature paper hint that amantadine did not fit well into the M2 channel. One strategy could be to design a drug that is better able to occupy the known binding sites, but now that we know the channel must \"shuttle\" the protons through, Hong says there are more options: \"Targeting the histidine may work just as well to block the channel.\"New and better antiviral drugs will aid those that didn\'t get vaccinated, or those that become ill before their vaccine becomes fully effective. Millions of people in the United States get the flu each year. The majority will recover without treatment, but thousands become sick enough to be hospitalized. According to CDC estimates, there are anywhere from 3,000 to 49,000 flu-related deaths each year. Effective drug treatment could prevent hospitalizations and reduce the number of complication-related deaths.Fighting disease in the futureResearch in this area will provide benefits beyond development of better antiviral drugs. Eventually, scientists will have enough data from NMR experiments to work with mathematicians on creating models that can more accurately predict the shape and structure a protein will have. These models, once tested and refined, could help researchers predict and identify previously unknown molecular interactions. A better understanding of the myriad of players that interact to make us feel good or bad each day could play a significant role in shaping future medical diagnostics and treatments. Studies that allow increasingly accurate unification of protein structure and function, like the NMR experiments done by Mei Hong, are steps on the path towards more effective, personalized medical treatments.","url"=>"","source"=>""),

It describes a process called coarsening. That\'s when \"a group of objects of different sizes transforms into fewer objects with larger average size, such that \'the big get bigger,\'\" says the paper. Examples of the process include the geologic formation of gemstones, the degradation of pharmaceutical suspensions and the manufacture of structural steels.Thiel and Evans were invited to write the paper after Thiel delivered a talk at an American Chemical Society meeting about their studies of coarsening, an emerging field in surface chemistry.Thiel worked with Mingmin Shen, a former Iowa State doctoral student who is now a post-doctoral research associate at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash., on the experimental side of the coarsening research. Evans worked with Da-Jiang Liu, an associate scientist at the Ames Laboratory, on the theoretical side of the project.The researchers, with the support of grants from the National Science Foundation, have been using scanning tunneling microscope technology - an instrument that allows them to see individual atoms - to study how coarsening happens on the surface of objects.They\'ve studied nanoscale particles grown on the surface of silver and how adding sulfur can increase coarsening. They\'re trying to learn the mechanism of that increase and understand the nature of the messengers that move atoms during the coarsening process.What Thiel and Evans are looking for is a general principle that explains what they call additive-enhanced coarsening. To do that, Thiel said they still need to collect and analyze data from more coarsening systems.Evans said a better understanding of the coarsening process can help researchers develop small structures - including nanoscale technologies, catalysts or drug suspensions - that resist coarsening and are therefore more durable. A better understanding could also help researchers manipulate coarsening to develop structures with a very narrow distribution of particle sizes, something important to some nanotechnologies.\"When we\'re building something on a small scale, for it to be useful, it has to be robust, it has to survive,\" Evans said. \"And one thing we\'re looking at is the stability of the very tiny structures that are crucial to nanoscale technologies.\"","url"=>"","source"=>""),

The virus begins an infection by attaching itself to a healthy cell. The healthy cell surrounds the virus and takes it inside through a process called endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the virus uses a protein called M2 to open a channel. Protons from the healthy cell flow through the channel into the virus and raise its acidity. That triggers the release of the virus\' genetic material into the healthy cell. The virus then hijacks the healthy cell\'s resources to replicate itself.Hong and her research team - Fanghao Hu, an Iowa State doctoral student in chemistry; and Wenbin Luo, a former Iowa State doctoral student who is now a spectroscopist research associate at Penn State University - focused their attention on the structure and dynamics of the proton-selective amino acid residue, a histidine in the transmembrane part of the protein, to determine how the channel conducts protons. Their work was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.Two models had been proposed for the proton-conducting mechanism:�� A \"shutter\" channel that expands at the charged histidine because of electrostatic repulsion, thus allowing a continuous hydrogen-bonded water chain that takes protons into the virus.�� Or a \"shuttle\" model featuring histidine rings that rearrange their structure in some way to capture protons and relay them inside.Hong\'s research team found that the histidine rings reorient by 45 degrees more than 50,000 times per second in the open state, but are immobile in the closed state. The energy barrier for the open-state ring motion agrees well with the energy barrier for proton conduction, which suggests that the M2 channel dynamically shuttles the protons into the virus. The chemists also found that the histidine residue forms multiple hydrogen bonds with water, which helps it to dissociate the extra proton.\"The histidine acts like a shuttle,\" Hong said. \"It picks up a proton from the exterior and flips to let it get off to the interior.\"The research not only provided atomic details of the proton-conducting apparatus of the flu virus, but also demonstrated the abilities of solid-state NMR.\"The structural information obtained here is largely invisible to conventional high-resolution techniques,\" the researchers wrote in their Science paper, \"and demonstrates the ability of solid-state NMR to elucidate functionally important membrane protein dynamics and chemistry.\"","url"=>"","source"=>""),

Petrich, in fact, is working to develop a testing device.The findings were published earlier this year in the journal Analytical Chemistry. The project was supported by a grant from the U.S. Department of Defense.The research is the result of an accidental discovery while Petrich and his collaborators were developing a fluorescence spectroscopy device that\'s now used in slaughterhouses to test livestock carcasses for feces and possible E. coli contamination.\"One day we were testing the apparatus by shining light on the carcass and we saw the spinal cord glow - it fluoresced,\" said Petrich, professor and chair of Iowa State\'s chemistry department. \"We saw the spinal cord through the skin. The light was pretty intense. It was an amazing result.\"That sparked some new thinking: Maybe fluorescence technology could be used to test animals for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy - what\'s often called mad cow disease. To reduce the risk of human exposure to the diseases, the brains and spinal cords of animals are removed during slaughter and processing. But there is no quick test to identify animals with the diseases.And so Petrich and a team of researchers began studying the feasibility of a fluorescence test. The team included Ramkrishna Adhikary, an Iowa State graduate student in chemistry; Prasun Mukherjee, a former Iowa State graduate student and current post-doctoral associate in chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh; Govindarajan Krishnamoorthy, a former Iowa State post-doctoral research associate and current assistant professor of chemistry at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati; Robert Kunkle of the U.S. Department of Agriculture\'s National Animal Disease Center in Ames; Thomas Casey of the National Animal Disease Center; and Mark Rasmussen of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\'s Center for Veterinary Medicine in Laurel, Md.The researchers collected 140 eyeballs from 73 sheep. Thirty five of those sheep were infected with scrapie; 38 were not. The researchers took fluorescence readings from various parts of the eyes of all the sheep.\"The bottom line is the scrapie-positive retinas fluoresced like crazy,\" Petrich said. \"And the scrapie-negative ones did not.\"A previous study published in the journal Veterinary Pathology reported that the function and structure of retinas are altered in cattle infected with transmissible mink encephalopathy. Members of that study team included Iowa State researchers M. Heather West Greenlee, an associate professor of biomedical sciences in the College of Veterinary Medicine; Justin Greenlee, a collaborator assistant professor of biomedical sciences; and Juergen Richt, a collaborator associate professor of veterinary microbiology and preventive medicine.Other studies have reported that lipofuscin, an intracellular fluorescent pigment, accumulates in the eyes of animals infected with the neurological diseases. Petrich and his team attribute the glow from scrapie-positive retinas to the elevated levels of lipofuscin.Whatever the cause, Petrich said it\'s clear there are distinct differences in the fluorescence and spectroscopic signatures of retinas from sheep that were naturally infected with scrapie and those that were not. And so he and his research team think there\'s great promise for a diagnostic test based on that discovery.That has Petrich starting to develop a device (he likes to call it a \"gizmo\") that could be used in meat plants to test the retinas of animals for signs of neurological diseases. He expects it will take several years to develop, build and test a useful device.\"What I like about this is it\'s really simple,\" Petrich said. \"It\'s light in and light out.\"","url"=>"","source"=>""),

The rankings are based on 20 data measurements including publications per faculty member, percent of faculty with grants, percent of female students and percent of students completing a doctorate within six years. The council last ranked doctoral program in 1995.The council\'s new report said the rankings are designed to improve doctoral education in the U.S. by providing administrators, faculty and funders with data that allows them to compare, evaluate and strengthen programs. It also gives students data to help them identify programs that meet their needs.\"Strong and competitive doctoral programs are a necessity for Iowa State University to help Iowa, the country and the world meet the challenges of the 21st century,\" said Iowa State President Gregory Geoffroy. \"They are magnets for attracting outstanding faculty and students. And they produce the research and creativity needed to build a more sustainable and healthy future.\"The research council reports its findings as ranges in two different rankings. The committee overseeing the report said it would be misleading to use a single number to rank programs because \"there are significant uncertainties and variability in any ranking process.\"The committee said its survey-based rankings (S-rankings) reflect surveys of faculty members who were asked to rate the 20 measures of program quality. Measures were weighted based on those responses. Those weighted measures varied from field to field.The committee said its regression-based rankings (R-rankings) reflect an indirect approach to identifying what faculty value in a program. A sample group of faculty were asked to rate several programs in their fields. A statistical analysis then calculated how measures should be weighed in each field to duplicate the results of the faculty ratings.Here are ten Iowa State doctoral programs that placed high in the rankings:Additional Iowa State doctoral programs in the top half of the rankings include psychology; genetics; meat science; health and human performance; computer science; human development and family studies; and chemical engineering.The full rankings are available on the website of the National Academies Press.In a letter accompanying the rankings, the leaders of the three national organizations that oversee the National Research Council called on universities to regularly update the study\'s data so programs can be continually evaluated.\"If this is done with the updated dataset as an important new tool, and we strive to improve what is already the world\'s strongest system of higher education,\" wrote Ralph Cicerone, president of the National Academy of Sciences; Charles Vest, president of the National Academy of Engineering; and Harvey Fineberg, president of the Institute of Medicine, \"we believe that American doctoral education can continue to bring enormous benefits to our citizens and remain the envy of the world.\"The three organizations, plus the National Research Council, are known as the National Academies and are charged with producing reports that help shape national policies, inform public opinion and advance the country\'s pursuit of science, engineering and medicine.","url"=>"","source"=>""),

Ultimately it could help drug researchers develop treatments to combat that resistance.To make their findings, the researchers purified and crystallized the membrane proteins that make up an efflux pump of E. coli bacteria. The researchers prepared some samples that contained the toxic heavy metals copper and silver and some that did not.The researchers used X-ray crystallography to compare the various structures, identify the differences and understand the mechanism that removes heavy-metal toxins from cells.Their paper specifically describes the crystal structure of CusA, one of three parts of the pumps responsible for removing toxins from bacteria. Yu said CusA is an inner membrane transporter which belongs to the resistance-nodulation-division protein superfamily. It consists of 1,047 amino acid residues and spans the inner membrane 12 times.What those pumps do, Yu wrote in a summary of his research, is \"recognize and actively export these substances out of bacterial cells, thereby allowing the bugs to survive in extremely toxic conditions.\"The research project was supported by the National Institutes of Health.

And so he and members of his research group studied the reactions of cellulosic materials in alcohols at high temperatures and pressures.They analyzed the products of the reactions using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Early experiments produced the expected sugar derivatives. Additional work, however, clearly revealed significant yields of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol.\"It was a real surprise,\" Trahanovsky said. \"These products were unexpected, so we never looked for them. But they were always there.\"Uses for ethylene glycol include auto antifreeze, polyester fabrics and plastic bottles. Propylene glycol has many uses, including as a food additive, a solvent in pharmaceuticals, a moisturizer in cosmetics and as a coolant in liquid cooling systems.Conversion of biomass to fuels and other chemicals can require strong acids or other harsh and expensive compounds. These processes also generate chemical wastes that have to be collected for safe disposal.The Iowa State researchers say they have found a technology that is simpler yet effective and also better for the environment.\"There is potential here,\" said Trahanovsky. \"It\'s not a wild dream to think this could be developed into a practical process.\"The biomass conversion process is based on the chemistry of supercritical fluids, fluids that are heated under pressure until their liquid and gas phases merge. In this case, Trahanovsky said the key results are significant yields of ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and other chemicals with low molecular weights. He said the process also produces alkyl glucosides and levoglucosan that can be converted into glucose for ethanol production or other uses.All this happens without the use of any expensive reagents such as acids, enzymes, catalysts or hydrogen gas, Trahanovsky said. The process even works when there are impurities in the biomass.The Iowa State University Research Foundation Inc. has filed for a patent of the technology.The research has been supported by grants from the Iowa Energy Center. Other Iowa State researchers who have contributed to the project include Ronald Holtan, a postdoctoral research associate in chemistry; Norm Olson, the project manager of the Iowa Energy Center\'s BECON facility near Nevada; Joseph Marshall, a former graduate student; and Alyse Hurd and Kyle Quasdorf, former undergraduate students.Trahanovsky said the research team is still working to develop and improve the conversion technology.And he does think the technology could be useful to industry.\"The starting materials for this are cheap,\" Trahanovsky said. \"And the products are reasonably high-value chemicals.\"","url"=>"","source"=>""),

Winter\'s research is receiving a boost by his being honored as the Carlyle G. Caldwell Chair in Chemistry at Iowa State.The two-year chair will provide him with supplemental annual funds for his teaching and research efforts. Endowed chair funds often are used to support graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, purchase additional equipment and supplies, and provide travel to professional meetings or for professional development.The Caldwell Chair was established in 1985 in honor of Iowa State chemistry alumnus Carlyle G. Caldwell and funded through contributions from corporations, foundations and individuals.Carlyle G. Caldwell was chairman and chief executive officer of the National Starch and Chemical Corp. until 1984 before becoming chair of the company\'s executive committee. He distinguished himself as a researcher and corporate executive in his more than 45 years with the company. Caldwell earned both his B.S. (1935) and Ph.D. (1940) degrees in chemistry from Iowa State.Caldwell\'s graduate research at Iowa State focused on the basic chemistry of corn starch, and he made pioneering research contributions in many areas in starch chemistry that later found widespread application in industry.Part of Winter\'s work is aimed at improved cancer therapies. He explained that in the traditional approach to chemotherapy, both healthy and diseased tissues are \"carpet bombed\" with toxic chemotherapy drugs injected into the bloodstream. Of course, serious side effects result from the destruction of healthy cells along with the cancer cells.\"We are working on a different approach,\" said Winter, assistant professor of chemistry, \"which involves developing a chemical mediator that selectively transports these toxic drugs to the diseased tissues. In this way, the mediator acts like a homing device to transport the toxic drugs selectively to the site of the tumor, leaving the healthy tissues unscathed.\"Winter said such targeted therapies hold the promise of minimizing the side effects that come from non-selective destruction of healthy tissues, while increasing potency.Winter\'s group also is working on other chemical tools with potential applications in biology and medicine, including a new class of fluorescent imaging tools that will allow tracking of biomolecules in the cell in real time.In addition, he also is developing what he describes as a molecular \"cage\" that releases drugs using precisely directed laser irradiation. \"The basic science needed for the construction of this tool,\" explained Winter, \"is poorly developed so we have to bootstrap our way to this goal by building a foundation of basic research. We must identify how molecular structure relates to our desired photochemical reactivity.\"So the lab work is an interesting mix of basic science and application-driven science.\"Winter said he is excited to receive the Caldwell funds.\"Equipping, staffing and maintaining a cutting-edge research laboratory in chemistry is a massively expensive enterprise,\" he said. \"The funds will be a major help in supporting the work of the graduate students and undergraduates in my lab, as well as purchasing supplies and equipment.\"His lab, which includes four Ph.D. students and four undergraduates, has relocated to Iowa State\'s new 135,000-square-foot chemistry building, Hach Hall.Nicola Pohl, professor of chemistry, was the previous holder of the Caldwell Chair.","url"=>"","source"=>""),

The diseases can cause unsightly sores, and can last a period of months, according to Pohl.The diseases are often fatal to dogs in the United States.\"The problem is, in places like Bangladesh, where people are in a nutritionally compromised state, peoples\' immune systems aren\'t strong enough, and the disease can be fatal,\" said Pohl.Normally, when a disease-causing agent enters the body, cells called macrophages engulf and start to destroy the agent.Leishmania-type diseases are resistant to this process.To test the theory on the resistance effect of the sugar coating, Pohl and Petersen developed an experiment that required creating small beads measuring one micron in diameter to mimic the pathogens.One group of beads was then coated with a type of sugar that is similar to that of Leishmania. Another set of beads was coated with a lactose-type sugar that isn\'t harmful to the cell. A third had no coating.The beads were then introduced into macrophages.When the uncoated beads were introduced into the macrophages, the cells noticed the beads and started an immune response, as they should.When the lactose-covered beads were introduced, they were also recognized and removed.When the Leishmania-sugar covered beads were introduced, the macrophages took a much longer time to recognize their presence. Then, the immune defense system slowed down or dampened the attacks.This dampening, Petersen and Pohl showed, is due to an interaction between the sugar on the bead and Toll-like receptor2 (TLR2) within the macrophage.\"There is something inherent about the sugars themselves, and the difference in these sugars, that dampens your normal response to the pathogen,\" said Pohl.Pohl said they don\'t yet know exactly what that interaction is or how it works, but she hopes that this research may lead to more research eventually beating the disease.\"Right now we don\'t have good therapeutics against Leishmaniasis, and we don\'t have a vaccine for it, so basically you can\'t do anything about it,\" she added.\"The more information we have about this, the more we learn about how to circumvent this to get an effective vaccine,\" she said.Petersen credits the partnership with Pohl as one of the key factors in understanding the problem.Pohl\'s chemistry background doesn\'t often lead her to look at whole organisms and Petersen, as a veterinary pathologist, previously didn\'t look at the chemistry.\"Many of these critical sub-molecular interactions are often glossed over by immunologists and biologists,\" said Petersen. \"But the work Nikki and I just published shows that they can make a much larger difference in how a pathogen is sensed by the immune system.\"The research staff also included Alex Osanya, an assistant scientist in veterinary pathology and Eun-Ho Song, a former graduate student in chemistry.","url"=>"","source"=>""),

Ultimate is a field game in which teams score by throwing a flying disc to other players to advance down the field and score. It was formerly known as Ultimate Frisbee.There are four championship divisions: open, women\'s, mixed and masters.\"It was nice to win after tasting defeat so many times in big games,\" said Kevin Seiler, team captain.The team finished 10th in the last world championship tournament in Australia in 2006. They also finished third at the U.S. nationals in 2005 and 2008, and second in the 2009 United States championships last fall to qualify for this year\'s world tournament.Thirteen of the 24 athletes on the Iowa-based team are current or former Iowa State students, with the remaining roster spots filled out by players from other college teams.Players from other teams were recruited for the trip because some original team members couldn\'t make the trip to Europe as each player had to pay his or her own way.The trip worked out well for two team members, John and Taiwo Misra, who were married just weeks before the tournament.\"The trip was really a nice springboard for a honeymoon,\" said John. \"It was a great excuse to be in Europe and we were able to travel to London and Rome after we won the tournament.\"Taiwo Misra makes a diving grab for a score in an early round match against a team from the United Kingdom.Team members Jon Staron and Rachel Derscheid; Lana and Kevin Seiler; and Amy Sheldahl and Seth Bartel are also married.Forty teams from around the world took part in the championships.While it is estimated that more 12,000 students around the country take part in Ultimate on the college club level, Seiler realizes that he competes in a sport that hasn\'t caught on completely in the mainstream of America yet.\"We\'re big in a sports community that nobody cares about,\" joked Seiler.Other Iowa State students and alumni on the team are: Ben Lyons, Marshalltown; Christine Rosen, Eden Prairie, Minn.; Amy and Rachel Sheldahl, Hull; John Misra, Ames; Taiwo Misra, Murfreesboro, Tenn.; Jon Staron, Marshalltown; Kurt Brorsen, Stillwater, Okla.; Lana Seiler, Hudson; Melissa Gibbs, Shell Rock; Rachel Derscheid, Ellston; and Seth Bartel, Hoffman Estates, Ill.","url"=>"","source"=>""),

Driving their project is the ability to run complex calculations and do better science.\"Petascale power is required for accuracy,\" said Monica Lamm, an Iowa State assistant professor of chemical and biological engineering and associate scientist at the U.S. Department of Energy\'s Ames Laboratory who studies complex molecular binding. \"Now we have to use methods that are less accurate and less reliable.\"Theresa Windus, an Iowa State professor of chemistry and an associate of the Ames Laboratory, said higher computing power will make a big difference in her studies of atmospheric particles: \"This allows us to get results we\'ve never had before.\"The source of the new and improved computing power is Blue Waters, a supercomputer that\'s being developed as a joint effort of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, its National Center for Supercomputing Applications, IBM, and the Great Lakes Consortium for Petascale Computation, which includes Iowa State.Blue Waters is expected to be the most powerful supercomputer in the world for open scientific research when it comes online in 2011. It will be the first system of its kind to sustain one petaflop performance - one quadrillion calculations per second - on a range of science and engineering applications.Blue Waters is supported by the National Science Foundation and the University of Illinois.Iowa State researchers Lamm, Windus and Mark Gordon, Distinguished Professor and Frances M. Craig Chair in chemistry, Ames Laboratory senior chemist and director of the lab\'s Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences Program, are leading Iowa State\'s work to develop computational chemistry software that can be scaled up to petascale computing systems. The research team also includes Masha Sosonkina, an adjunct associate professor of computer science, of electrical and computer engineering and an Ames Laboratory scientist; and Brett Bode, the software development manager for the Blue Waters project at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.The researchers\' work is supported by grants of more than $1.6 million from the National Science Foundation.The Iowa State researchers are working to scale up two computational chemistry software codes for use on Blue Waters and its thousands of parallel processors and high-speed connections. (\"You don\'t just put a CD into the computer and hit install,\" Windus said.) One of the codes is called GAMESS and was developed by Gordon\'s research group at Ames Laboratory and Iowa State; the other is NWChem, for which Windus was the lead developer when she was at the U.S. Department of Energy\'s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash. The computing power of Blue Waters is expected to help the software deliver better, more accurate answers to three specific research problems that have been too computationally demanding to do full-scale calculations with current research tools.Lamm is studying how dendrimers (large polymers with many branches) bind to ligands (smaller molecules that bind with other molecules to form larger complexes). A better understanding of the binding could have applications in health technologies such as drug delivery and water treatment.Windus is studying aerosols in the atmosphere and how the tiny particles grow at the molecular level. She said a better understanding of aerosols is important to understanding the chemistry of the atmosphere. She\'s using NWChem for the research.Gordon is studying the molecular dynamics of water because many aspects of its behavior aren\'t very well understood. To do his studies, he\'s using a computational method that allows researchers to look at a large molecular system by splitting it into fragments. That allows researchers to make quicker calculations while maintaining accurate results. The method is only available on the GAMESS computational chemistry tool developed by Gordon and his research group.Lamm said she\'s hoping the Blue Waters project will help the Iowa State researchers move their projects ahead.\"A problem of computational chemistry has been asking what computing power is available and how can we simplify the science for the computer,\" she said. \"Now we have a chance to do our problems the right way.\"","url"=>"","source"=>""),

He strives to create a positive atmosphere in which students feel involved and comfortable asking questions, and he makes himself available to work with students outside of class.His instructional technique also helps explain his success. ��I believe that learning mathematics depends on understanding ideas in general terms as well as being able to perform the calculations. When introducing a new concept in class, I first try to explain it and what makes it important without going into technical details, and I start with very simple examples. Then I cover the technical aspects behind it and proceed by working out calculations.��When not teaching, Powell is actively involved in research. His research interests are in applied, computational, and pure harmonic analysis and in  signal processing and mathematical data analysis. He has received three National Science Foundation grants, is author or co-author of 19 papers, has given numerous invited talks, and has organized several conferences and workshops.��Alex is one of the department��s most productive researchers as well as one of our best teachers,�� says Department Chair Dietmar Bisch. ��He is very deserving of this award.��The Jeffrey Nordhaus Award was established in 1982 by a gift from Katherine Stumb Nordhaus and George Nordhaus in memory of their son, Jeffrey, victim of an airplane crash in 1979.

				array("title"=>"Fields Medalist Vaughan Jones Joins the Department","description" => "Vaughan Jones has accepted a faculty position as Distinguished Professor with the Department of Mathematics beginning in the fall of 2011. A preeminent mathematician who comes to Vanderbilt from the University of California, Berkeley, Jones will be a tremendous addition to the department��s already strong research group in operator algebras.Jones�� contributions to mathematics have their origins in his work on subfactors, inclusions of certain highly noncommutative algebras of operators on Hilbert space known as von Neumann algebras. Von Neumann algebras were introduced by the legendary John von Neumann in the 1920s in his investigations of quantum physics, ergodic theory, and group representation theory. They were the central objects of Alain Connes�� work in the ��70s that led to his Fields Medal in 1982, the first one in operator algebras.Jones introduced in the early ��80s a notion of index for a von Neumann subalgebra (or a subfactor) and found that indices of subfactors take on only very special values. He discovered that this totally unexpected rigid behavior was related to the existence of a new braid group representation that comes with each subfactor. Jones used his representation to construct a new polynomial invariant for knots and links, now called the Jones polynomial. This amazing discovery led to a whole new branch of modern mathematics, perhaps most adequately called quantum topology. Jones�� work paved the way to many new and exciting interactions between a priori widely separate areas of mathematics and physics, including statistical mechanics, conformal field theory, knot theory, low dimensional topology, von Neumann algebra theory, quantum groups, representation theory, category theory, and quantum computing. His most recent work on subfactors, planar algebras, and random matrix theory has uncovered many new and beautiful structures and connections and has generated a lot of interest and excitement among researchers in the above-mentioned areas.In 1990, Jones received the Fields Medal for his work. The Fields Medal is awarded once every four years to mathematicians not over 40 years of age for outstanding discoveries in mathematics.

				array("title"=>"Top Ranking for Our Graduate Program in New NRC Report","description" => "The Ph.D. program of the Vanderbilt mathematics department received high ratings in a new report from the National Research Council (NRC) that offers insights into the quality of doctoral programs in mathematics at research universities in the United States. Released in September 2010, the new report no longer provides a definite ranking of programs, but various analyses of the data places our program at number 16 in the so-called S ranking, and at number 31 in the R ranking (see http://chronicle.com/article/NRC-Rankings-Overview-/124743/ for a sortable list). Thus, in both of these rankings, our department fares dramatically better than in the 1995 NRC ranking, which placed us at number 84.Given that graduate education is a top priority for Vanderbilt, this steep ascent by our department is hardly surprising. ��For the last decade, Vanderbilt has been devoting increasing attention and resources to its Ph.D. programs throughout the entire campus,�� says Dennis Hall, vice provost for research and dean of the Graduate School. ��All of that effort and emphasis has placed graduate education at Vanderbilt on a steep upward trajectory.��Math Department Chair Dietmar Bisch adds, ``Our department scored highly in several categories that indicate the high quality of our faculty, including percentage of faculty with research grants and publications per faculty. It is exciting for us to receive this recognition in one of the most anticipated evaluations of Ph.D. programs in mathematics.����This latest NRC report is based on data collected from 127 Ph.D. programs in mathematics during the 2005-2006 academic year. The data was gathered on 20 key characteristics identified by the NRC as indicative of the quality of Ph.D. programs, including:* Publications per faculty member* Citations per publication* Percent faculty with grants* Awards per allocated faculty* Average GRE-quantitative score* Percent 1st-year students with full support* Percent 1st-year students with external funding* Percent female students* Annual average number of Ph.D.s 2002 to 2006* Time to degree* Percent students in academic positions* Student work spaceThe report provided two overall rankings, the S (survey-based) ranking and the R (regression analysis-based) ranking, to illustrate how the data collected can be interpreted. For each ranking two numerical values were computed. These two values correspond to the ranking percentiles, namely the 5th percentile and the 95th percentile.Thus, for example, in the so-called ��S ranking�� of the report, perhaps the most important ranking, measuring the overall quality of the program, our department was ranked by the two values 11 and 31. What does this mean? The S ranking is based on a survey that asked faculty (the raters) in mathematics to rate the importance of the twenty NRC selected criteria. Based on the answers of 50% of randomly selected raters, weights for each criterion were computed, and these weights were then applied to the data of each of the 127 Ph.D. programs in mathematics to produce a numerical ranking. The process was repeated 500 times and 450 of these computations resulted in numbers between 11 and 31 for our program. This places us between the top 9% and the top 24% of the 127 departments ranked. In the so-called ��R ranking��, a different way of computing weights for the NRC criteria, these two numbers were 17 and 48.The Vanderbilt mathematics program fares particularly well when compared to other Ph.D. programs at Vanderbilt. For instance, the S ranking places us among the top ten programs university wide, and among the top four in the College of Arts & Science.In addition to the above two rankings, there were also three so-called dimensional rankings, concerned with Research Activity, Student Support and Outcomes, and Student/Faculty Diversity. The corresponding numbers can be seen in the table below.","url"=>"","source"=>""),

The practice is so pervasive that one third of Citigroup's (C) second quarter earnings and one half of the company's third quarter earnings were derived from reducing the amount put aside for bad loans. Similarly, 56% of Bank of America's (BAC) second quarter pre-tax profit, 27% of JPMorgan's (JPM) second quarter net income, and 10% of JPMorgan's most recent quarterly net income all came from loan loss reserve reductions. As I noted when JPMorgan reported, the $900 million reduction in loan loss reserves for the third quarter looks especially ridiculous considering non-performing loans actually rose during the period. There are some who argue that this is nothing to worry about. After all, the loan loss reserve component of earnings is clearly spelled out in the \"significant items\" list of the firms' press releases so there is no attempt to hide anything and furthermore, it is quite reasonable for these firms to be reducing the amount set aside for bad loans as the housing market is improving.

				array("title" => "Which Is Better - Physical Gold Or Gold ETFs?","description" => "Years of reading and thinking about this issue and actually investing in both shiny gold bullion and paper/digital gold has given me the following perspective: If you are a long term (read 10+ years) investor looking for a secure hedge against market volatility, buying physical gold beats buying gold ETFs overall. Some considerations in buying physical gold are management fees in buying ETFs versus storing costs with physical gold, coin or bullion. If you buy an ETF like SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), you lose about .40% of the value of your investment every year in management fees. If you buy physical gold, there are three principle associated costs - storage, insurance, and transportation. Insurance is dependent on the volume of gold you own; however, both storage and transportation costs are less dependent on minor changes in volume. On the other hand, ETF management fee is totally dependent on volume/value. From an optimization point of view, if you are buying gold long term, in large volumes, and you plan to keep on adding to that volume in good quantities, both storage and transportation costs will go down on a per unit basis. As for insurance, many people will consider paying a few dollars today worth more than nothing when the next MF Global crisis occurs.","url" => "","source" => "seekingalpha.com"),

This is the fund that pays lenders on loans that go bad, which is why FHA loans are available for borrowers with relatively lower credit scores. The FHA insures roughly $1.1 trillion in mortgages. The report also looks at the FHA's capital reserves, which are there to cover future loan losses. For the past three years, those reserves have fallen below the congressionally mandated 2 percent of the portfolio, or around $22 billion, but have not gone negative.

How would I know? My neighborhood isn't near a river, and I don't think we've ever had a flood. -- Dry Guy. Dear Dry, You're right. Homeowners policies don't cover flooding or any kind of water damage from water that enters the house at or below ground level. Fortunately, the federal government offers flood insurance. The question is: Do you need flood insurance if you don't live along a body of water like a lake or river? The answer is: maybe. For sure, you need flood insurance if you live near a coastal area, as disastrous storms such as Katrina and Sandy have proven. Flooding often accompanies hurricanes, and not just along the coast but miles inland. Also, ocean-based earthquakes can cause tsunamis capable of causing flooding not just directly along the coast but also for some distance inland. (Remember the tsunami that was predicted to ravage the Oregon-Washington state coast two years ago, caused by the quake off the coast of Japan?) But you might still consider flood insurance even if you live far from a beach or riverbank. The policies cover not only overflows of bodies of water but also torrential rain runoff, though only in certain circumstances. If heavy rain pours into your basement in Drytown, USA, flood insurance might provide some compensation, but only if: One other home nearby also is flooded, or you own two or more acres. Your basement or lowest level is a walkout or has a ground-level access door, so the water can flow out, not just in.","url" => "","source" => "yahoo.com"),

The reason we are considering this mortgage prepayment is to make the elimination of the mortgage coincide with retirement in 2020. Please, share your thoughts. I think it's a great goal to have your home loan paid off by the time you retire. Making a big additional principal payment, as long as you don't have a mortgage prepayment penalty, will shorten your loan substantially and reduce your total interest expense. You can use the amortization schedule on Bankrate's mortgage payment calculator to determine both the new loan term and the interest savings. Since you just refinanced last year, you have a great interest rate on your loan -- only 21 basis points more than Bankrate's national average of 3.04 percent for a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percentage point.

				array("title" => "Emergency Funds That Are Right For Your Tax Bracket.","description" =>"Financial experts typically recommend that you should have the equivalent of three to six months' worth of income tucked away in an emergency fund. While that is an easy-to-calculate measure, it does not take into account other factors that influence how much money you will need. Such factors include the level of job you have, the industry you are in, how much your expenses are and what other resources you have to draw on. Your ideal emergency fund will take your overall income and expense profile into account in order to give you the best chance of managing an emergency loss of income. Covering Your Expenses. One problem with traditional emergency fund size advice is that it addresses income rather than expenses. If you lose your job, your expenses will need to be covered. For example, if your monthly income is $5,000 and your expenses are $3,000, you only need $3,000 in emergency funding to keep you going for the month. In lower tax brackets, your income and expenses are likely to be closer together, as more income is spent on basic living needs. In higher tax brackets, a larger percentage of income goes into savings vehicles, such as college savings, retirement plans and saving for a vacation, although the overall savings rate is in decline for all tax brackets. These outflows of cash can be deferred during a financial crisis. The goal of an emergency fund is to keep a roof over your head and food on the table.","url" => "","source" => "yahoo.com"),

First, Bryan, if you deferred paying income tax on the interest earnings over the years, the tax bill comes due in the year that the savings bonds are redeemed or reach final maturity, whichever comes first. And Gerri, I hope you have Series EE savings bonds and not Series E. All Series E savings bonds have stopped earning interest and have matured. Even the Series EE savings bonds that were issued between January 1980 and October 1982 have stopped earning interest and have matured. Series EE savings bonds reach final maturity after 30 years. If you have a Series EE bond that reaches final maturity in 2016, you bought it in 1986. You used to be able to exchange your Series EE (or E) savings bonds for Series HH savings bonds. That allowed you to continue to defer income taxes on the interest earnings from the Series EE savings bonds, although not on the subsequent interest earned on the Series HH bonds. However, the government hasn't sold Series HH savings bonds since 2004.

While the depreciation rules have become quite generous lately for small businesses, the concept of recognizing gain on the sale remains the same. When it comes to personal property as opposed to real property, the depreciation recapture rules aren't that favorable. Real estate depreciation recapture is termed section 1250 recapture and carries a maximum 25 percent tax rate. Personal property depreciation recapture has no maximum tax rate; it is taxed at the same rate as your other ordinary income, which could be as high as 35 percent. Personal property depreciation recapture is termed section 1245 recapture. If you bought the tractor for $10,000 and you've claimed the full $10,000 in depreciation over the years, your basis for gain or loss is zero. If you sell it outright for $1,000 you'll have $1,000 in section 1245 depreciation recapture. On IRS Form 4797, you would complete lines 19 through 25 to reflect the sale of the tractor at a gain. Remember, if you trade in the tractor, you eliminate recapture.

It's taking retirement plan distributions in such a way as to best minimize income tax so more money is left for you. It's tough to make generalizations about the right way to do this because people own retirement assets in vehicles with different tax characteristics. Following are three retirement plan distribution scenarios. In each scenario, a hypothetical couple has $600,000 in assets. To maintain their lifestyle, they need $42,000 of income per year in retirement, $24,000 of which will come from Social Security. They must rely on their retirement funds to provide income of at least $18,000 per year. Assuming that tax rates don't change drastically in the foreseeable future, let's look at the best way to take distributions when retirement assets are invested in various vehicles, including pretax accounts such as traditional 401(k) plans, individual retirement accounts and pension plans; after-tax vehicles such as Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s; and nonretirement vehicles, such as a brokerage account containing stocks.","url" => "","source" => "yahoo.com"),

Their source for these features was a concept video posted on YouTube. Fox 5 were embarrassed and we were laughing, but the iPhone has taken a step closer to getting a surface keyboard thanks to the work of a student in the UK. Florian Kraeutli is studying MSc Cognitive Computing at Goldsmiths, University of London. He has been undertaking a project related to user interfaces and decided to do a proof of concept for a virtual keyboard. What Florian did was to take advantage of the accelerometer inside the iPhone to pick up on tiny vibrations (both strength and frequency) made when tapping a surface the phone is lying on. The end result is a usable keyboard that doesn��t requires interaction with the touchscreen. As the video demonstrates, with some training Florian��s Vibrative software can tell the difference between each tap and relate that to a key. At the moment he��s achieving 80% accuracy, but it varies depending on the type and size of the surface. The accuracy also increases if you train the phone on each surface type and for each key tap. The paper keyboard layout he uses is optional, but certainly helps you tap in the right location for any given key. Florian��s software was developed using a jailbroken iPhone, but he believes it can work with any phone that has an accelerometer. If the accuracy can be improved and the training required minimized, there��s no reason to think this couldn��t become an official app or picked up by Apple Inc/Google/Microsoft as a standard feature for future handsets.","url" => "","source" => "yahoo.com"),

Still, as with every Android-based device, there��s a lot more you can do when you enable root access and gain control of the entire OS. Because the Nexus 7 is a \"Google Experience�� tablet, there are only a few steps to follow in order to gain root access. A common saying in the Android community is that all you need in order to root a Nexus product is Fastboot OEM Unlock. The point behind this statement is that no additional work needed to take place in order to gain access to the bootloader on your tablet. This statement, while technically true, drastically understates what is actually involved in this process. In order to use that command effectively, you need to have the Android SDK installed from Google, which in turn requires that you have an up-to-date version of Java installed on your computer. For the average user (read: not a developer) this is entirely unnecessary. The Android SDK takes up a fair chunk of storage, and unless you are already using Java for something else on your PC it is pointless to have it installed.

That��s a whole lot of apps, and it would represent the largest total ever for a newly-launched platform. Heins is pushing hard to get developers on board, and RIM has been offering a wide variety of ways for developers to easily make the jump to the QNX-powered OS. The most well-known is the Android app player, which made its debut in PlayBook OS 2.0 and will continue to feature in BlackBerry 10. RIM also offers support for native C and C++ apps, Adobe Air, HTML5 apps (viw the WebWorks SDK), and the Java apps that run on current BlackBerry smartphones. But even with all those options, BlackBerry has struggled to attract developers the way iOS and Android have �� despite boasting the highest revenue per app of those three platforms.

Dubbed Pok��mon Zukan, the app will imitate the actual in-game Pok��dex, and provide a comprehensive list of Pok��mon along with detailed information about each one. Unfortunately for some Pok��nthusiasts, this app is currently only releasing in Japan, with no mention of release in other regions. The app will cost 170 yen (around $2). Perhaps a little obnoxiously, the vanilla app only comes with 150 entries, and requires four DLC purchases priced at 500 yen ($6) each in order to complete the other missing 500 or so entries. The bigger story is that �� aside from the occasional CD-i Zelda game �C Nintendo has always stood staunchly against putting their characters and franchises onto other devices that directly compete with their own. They refuse to release games for phones and tablets because that would directly compete with their portable gaming hardware. The Pok��mon Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Nintendo, so it might seem odd that Nintendo allowed them to push out an iOS Pok��dex, especially since Nintendo��s own 3DS already has a Pok��dex. However, The Pok��mon Company has the authority to use the franchise however they think would help promote the brand. It��s also possible that the higher total pricing of the iOS app could be a reason why Nintendo didn��t fight its release, as it costs a total of $26, whereas the 3DS Pok��dex only costs $15, so Nintendo might��ve gotten yen signs in its eyes. The release of the iOS app could also signal Nintendo loosening up on its usual stance and testing the iOS waters, but only time will tell on that front.","url" => "","source" => "yahoo.com"),

Despite not having super-fast 4G LTE data connectivity, demand for the device was extremely high. So high that Google officially sold out later that day. Now buyers that thought they had a new phone in the mail are getting notices that their order is being delayed for up to three weeks. Tensions were already inflamed after many Android enthusiasts spent an hour or more trying to successfully order Google��s new flagship phone. The launch day festivities were hampered by errors that intermittently emptied users�� carts and caused the payment screen to freeze. Now many of those that managed to place an order are adding their voices to the already strong chorus chastising Google for a ham-handed launch. According to reports on the r/nexus4 sub-Reddit, a small number of users in the US and Europe have gotten shipping emails for their devices. Roughly half of orders placed on Tuesday are now backordered. It seems that everyone else is getting the form email explaining the high demand has depleted stock. Google is now saying that it will take three weeks to ship the phones it has already sold. Until then, customers are staring at pending transactions for several hundred dollars on their card statements. When the devices do ship, Google will be refunding the cost of shipping. It seems like Google massively underestimated how many phones were going to be sold, and also failed to cut off orders when it was out of stock. Google��s email provides instructions on cancelling orders, but with pending sales taking up to three weeks, it will be quite some time before any new orders can be placed. Maybe now someone will take that eBay seller up on his $1,900 Nexus.","url" => "","source" => "yahoo.com"),

With the release of the J Butterfly in Japan and the launch of the Droid DNA on Verizon Wireless here in the US, the rest of the world is probably feeling a bit left out. After all, it was only recently that the HTC One X+ made its way to international carriers. A leaked photo today revealed to the world the existence of a phone that looks closely related to the J Butterfly and the Droid DNA, being called the HTC Deluxe (or DLX). Nothing regarding the specs on this phone have been released, but given HTC��s recent releases it is hard to imagine this 5-inch phone having anything other than a 1080p screen with a quad-core Snapdragon and 2GB of RAM. This hardware would place the phone right in line with HTC��s most recent smartphone announcements, and gives the UK carriers a phone just like the Droid DNA and J Butterfly. Android 4.1 running Sense 4+ is expected to be running the DLX, though there��s not yet any mention of pricing or availability. The design of the DLX more closely resembles the HTC Rezound, with its red soft buttons on the bottom and the subtle red accents on the front of the phone. HTC��s new front-facing camera with a wider frame and IPX5 waterproofing could be among the features offered with this phone, as each have been seen with the Droid DNA and the J Butterfly. If HTC is planning to release this phone by the end of the year, it is most likely that there would be a launch event similar to the ones seen in Japan and NYC recently.

Quite simply, this is a case for your iPhone 5 that doubles as a snack and definitely won��t protect your smartphone for very long (if at all). The Survival Senbei case is constructed from Japanese rice crackers, known as senbei, which are a popular snack item for older people across the country. All we know about the case at this point is it has been thought up by a middle-aged Japanese woman called Mariko, who��s pretty good at molding the crackers into an iPhone-like shape. The problem is, the case is super expensive and doesn��t work very well outside of being a tasty snack. For roughly $47 you get a case that has a 76% chance of breaking when placing an iPhone inside it, a 50% chance of breaking if you try increasing the volume on your phone, and best of all, an 89% chance of breaking if placed in a pocket! So basically, this is a snack you can store around an iPhone you don��t mind carrying �� carefully �� in your hand. And even if you still want one after reading this, be prepared to join a waiting list. Mariko can produce about three of these handcrafted cases per day. There is an order page, but delivery time is listed as taking at least a month. I��m pretty sure you could go out and buy a six-pack of rice bars and some tape for roughly half the cost of the Survival case, wrap them around your iPhone, and end up with a \"case�� that actually manages to offer some protection for your phone. Alternatively, buy one of the many cheap, non-edible iPhone 5 cases out there and keep the $20+ you save for buying a range of other snacks.","url" => "","source" => "yahoo.com"),

ICANN has been contacted regarding this matter, but since the rogue member has had no problems posing as Steve Kondik in the past, the process is rather complicated.

Ever since we moved from CRT to LCD as our main display tech, manufacturers have been reducing their thickness to the point where a 50-inch+ displays that��s under 10mm thick isn��t uncommon. That reduction in thickness is set to continue with Japanese company Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd. announcing that it has used inkjet printing technology to develop a thinner light guide plate. The light guide plate is a key component of any backlit display. Typically manufactured from a clear resin, the plate has a pattern etched into it that helps guide the light evenly across an entire display. Use a poor light guide plate and the output of a screen will look patchy and diminish the overall quality of the image. Light guide plates are usually manufactured using injection molding or screen printing, but by using an inkjet printing method Sumitomo managed to reduce the thickness of the plate to as thin as 30 micrometers, which is 0.03mm. The other advantage using an inkjet printing method offers is how quick and easy it is to change the pattern etched in the resin. That means it should be easier, and therefore cheaper, for Sumitomo to experiment with new designs and create better light guide plates.

Three new displays were unveiled initially that took advantage of the company��s WhiteMagic and Pixel Eyes technology. But now another, very low power display has been introduced by the company. Typical LCD panels require some form of illumination to work well. This is usually achieved by adding a backlight. The problem with a backlight is it requires a lot of power and therefore has a big impact on overall power use of a device. Japan Display has managed to develop an LCD that does not require a backlight. Instead, it relies on reflecting the light hitting the panel to render a monochrome image. Color filters are then used to produce the final color image the user sees. This isn��t a new idea, but in the past it hasn��t worked very effectively for displays that need a good light source, e.g. the Game Boy Advance.","url" => "","source" => "yahoo.com"),

We��ve seen this trend beginning over the past few years and it��s only gaining momentum as time moves forward. And now Philips, a major player in the lighting industry, is getting out in front of the trend with their smartphone-controlled, consumer-focused, fully gadget-ized, Hue lighting system. The Hue system consists of three networked LED bulbs and a controller. The bulbs fit in a standard socket and appear to be normal, 50W-equivalent LED lamps, but they are actually much more than that. Each bulb has 11 LEDs inside and can glow any color of the rainbow (up to 16 million of them), including all the shades of white that we normally associate with indoor lighting. Each bulb also has built-in wireless, using Zigbee��s Light Link standard. This is a mesh network with a range of about 90 feet, so the bulbs can communicate with one another, as opposed to all having to be within the range of the controller. That controller stays plugged into your home��s ethernet connection, so by using your local network, you can customize your lights using a smartphone or tablet. Each controller can work with up to 50 bulbs, so a single unit could have complete control over a very large space. Multiple controllers could be used at once or larger structures or more complex arrangements.","url" => "","source" => "yahoo.com"),

One important detail to know about the bulb is that it��s an ��A21��, which refers to the shape and size. A standard, household bulb is an A19 which is 2.375 inches in diameter, while A21 is 2.625 inches. That might not make a difference most of the time, but it will in some fixtures. The new model is considerable taller than a standard Philips LED bulb as well, at about 5 inches (including the socket).

In fact, all mammals have evolved to have a predictable day-night cycle with an ��endogenous clock system�� set in the brain that runs on a near 24-hour period. This is called ��circadian,�� from the Latin word circa and diem (about a day). According to a recent review article published in the British Journal of Nutrition, when this internal clock system is disrupted, over time, it can lead to hormonal imbalances, sleep problems, susceptibility to diseases like cancer, and even reduce life span.

Grown and on my own, I avoided any contact with eggplant until I met my future husband. His Armenian and Greek heritage guaranteed the vegetable would be a staple on his parents' table. To my surprise, Todd's mother served dishes that took eggplant into unexpected territory. The best of these were appetizer dips: Grilled, the eggplant flesh took on a lovely smoky-flavor.

But not everyone knows that there is a second climbing season that arrives in the fall, after the monsoon has departed for another year. The fall season is much quieter and more tranquil than the spring, affording climbers more solitude in the mountains. The 2012 fall Himalayan climbing season officially got underway at the end of August when teams began arriving in Kathmandu. Most spent a few days in Nepal's capital city organizing their gear and putting the final touches on their preparation before they begin the trek to their respective Base Camps throughout the Himalaya. That hike generally helps to start the acclimatization process that will prepare them for living at high altitude over the coming weeks.","url" => "","source" => "www.gadling.com"),

To help skiers and snowboarders prepare for their winter adventures, Liftopia, the largest online site for purchasing lift tickets, has launched their Red Hot End of Summer Sale. This limited-time event features more than 32,000 deals on discounted passes from over 60 ski resorts across North America. Some of these tickets are being offered at prices that are as much as 86% below their normal price, which makes buying a ski pass in September seem like a really smart idea.","url" => "","source" => "www.gadling.com"),

On an annual basis, only about 20,000 people pass through its gates, despite the fact that it contains some of the most breathtaking backcountry in all of North America. There is a movement afoot to expand the park's borders, however, and if successful, advocates of the plan believe that it could attract many more travelers to the region. A group of conservationists, led by former U.S. Senator Dan Evans and mountaineer Jim Wickwire, have proposed an expansion to the North Cascades National Park that would add an additional 237,000 acres to its already impressive 500,000+. They also propose spending $23 million over five years to add or upgrade park amenities - something that is a bit of a tough sell with Congress these days. Proponents of the plan feel that the addition of the extra land would move park boundaries closer to main access roads, giving it a higher profile with travelers passing through the region. It is hoped that the easier access and enhanced amenities would at the very least lure a few more visitors from Seattle, a major metropolitan area, which sits less than three hours away.","url" => "","source" => "www.gadling.com"),

William to Aviemore was unmarked and there was no guidebook yet. Kevin was kind enough to email me PDFs of the page proofs. I never saw anyone else doing the trail and only heard of one other hiker, a German who was a day ahead of me. Now the East Highland Way is fully established. The guidebook is not only in print now, it's on its third edition. Kevin's website is getting tons of hits, and his publisher has added some stuff for the techies in the form of a free Android mobile phone app for the route, which is now available on the Google Play store.

The avid paddler from Austin launched his attempt to set a new speed record for kayaking the length of the Amazon River, a waterway that runs more than 4400 miles (7081 kilometers) in length. The entire expedition is expected to last several months. Hansen began his journey on Mount Mismi, a snow-capped peak located in a remote section of the Peruvian Andes. The 18,363-foot (5597-meter) mountain has been identified as the most distant source of the Amazon with the Rio Apurimac, one of the prime tributaries for the river, beginning on its slopes. As it rushes down the mountain, the water picks up speed and power, creating dangerous Class V and VI+ rapids. West will need to successfully navigate those treacherous waters in the early days of the expedition. Reading the early updates on Hansen's Amazon Express website, it seems that low water flow at the headwaters have made it tough going over the first few days. At times there hasn't been enough water to even paddle, forcing him to portage around certain sections. Carrying gear and a kayak through lush rainforests isn't easy either, which only serves to cause further delays.","url" => "","source" => "www.gadling.com"),

If you're looking for something a bit different for your next vacation, try Orkney. Here are a few tips to make your trip easier. Getting there. Regular flights service Kirkwall airport from Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Glasgow, and Inverness. There's also a long ferry from Aberdeen if you want to bring a car along. The ferry is no cheaper than the flight and takes several hours from Aberdeen as opposed to just one, so if you aren't bringing a car, it's probably best to go by air. Getting around. This can be a bit tricky. There's a public bus service but it's a bit limited and isn't timed with the ferry service. The ferries are better. They serve all the inhabited islands and are reasonably priced. Most are car ferries so you can bring your vehicle along. You have to be careful with the ferry times, however, as the last ferry often leaves pretty early.

The country's Ministry of Home Affairs announced recently that travelers visiting the Himalayan country will be required to hire support staff of either a porter or a guide. The policy shift won't affect groups of hikers, however, as they were already required to travel with a government approved trekking agency. This move comes in the wake of the brutal murder of a Belgian trekker who was hiking solo in Nepal's Langtang National Park earlier this year. Government officials believe that by requiring all hikers to have support staff with them at all times there will be a level of supervision and accountability in place that isn't there now. It should also ensure travelers remain safe while in remote areas of the country while also providing more jobs for local porters and guides. Hiring a guide or porter shouldn't have a significant impact on travel budgets for solo trekkers who are often experienced travelers looking to visit the Himalaya on the cheap. The government of Nepal estimates it will mean an increase of about $10 per day, which they believe will have no impact on the number of tourists who visit the country. A solo trek in Nepal has been a popular escape for adventure travelers for decades and it is a shame that it will no longer be an option. On the other hand, if it keeps visitors safe and employs more of the local guides then it is hard to argue against this move.","url" => "","source" => "www.gadling.com"),

The National Park Service, which conducted the study, says that even though many of the parks, such as Yellowstone and Yosemite, have seen record numbers of visitors in recent years, those travelers are actually spending 15 percent less time inside the park while they are there. Park officials say that a major reason why visits are now shorter than they were two decades ago is that an increasing number of travelers are booking their accommodations outside the park boundaries. Many of the larger parks actually have rustic lodges and campsites that have been popular places to stay for years, but it seems that fewer visitors are choosing to book them when they make their vacation plans. This accounts for at least a portion of the decline in the length of visits, as the study showed that 4.5 million fewer guests stayed the night inside the parks in 2011 than they did in 1994. That's down 25 percent in just 17 years. It seems that the parks are as popular as ever but camping isn't as viable of an option as it once was. This runs directly counter to market trends, which show that Americans have increased their spending on outdoor recreation an average of 5 percent over each of the past five years.

Hipmunk uses a style of this data on their search engine called \"agony,\" which is a measure of suffering incurred by lower leg room, higher baggage fees and a variety of other variables that can make airline travel miserable. That level of duress can be applied to other experiences as well. To apply this to experiential travel, it's first useful to think about the influences presented to any person in motion. While external influences like class of service, traffic and weather affect every passenger, internal factors such as purpose (i.e., business, leisure, wedding or funeral), health and state of mind can vary by each person. Add up the external influences in parallel then multiply that number by each person's perspective, say, their Coefficient of Travel Tolerance (COTT), and one can produce a relative comparison between each experience. So someone with a low coefficient of travel tolerance (i.e., someone with a high tolerance for difficult travel) could handle a journey in a chicken bus just as well as someone with a high coefficient (i.e., someone who hates leaving home) could handle a flight in international first class.","url" => "","source" => "www.gadling.com"),

The pack you choose will have a big impact on the comfort and success of your trip. To help you make the right choice, use this guide on how to choose the perfect backpack for traveling. Size Matters. For those who think they can just walk into the nearest sporting goods store and choose whichever pack looks the nicest, you will probably end up being very uncomfortable on your trip. The right pack should complement your torso length and sit snugly on your hips. Instead of measuring the length of your entire body, focus on the area from your shoulders to your hipbones. Likewise, you'll need to choose the appropriate capacity of the bag. While REI suggests choosing a pack that's 80 liters or more for an extended trip, I don't think this is necessary unless you'll be hiking and camping for two weeks or longer. Most of the backpackers I know, myself included, use packs that are about 55 liters for extended traveling, which is plenty of space unless you're a heavy packer. Don't Be Cheap. I'm not saying the most expensive backpack is necessarily the best; however, having a good backpack can make or break your trip. If your backpack is uncomfortable, you'll have a difficult time enjoying yourself. I'd recommend going to a passionate outfitter, like REI, where knowledgeable staff can help you choose the perfect pack. It's a good idea before purchasing to walk around with rocks in the backpack to test it out. And, if the more expensive pack feels more comfortable, buy it.","url" => "","source" => "yahoo.com"),

If you want to do a cruise, fly into Baltra Island and take a cheap bus to Puerto Ayora in Santa Cruz. This is the port where most cruises leave from. You'll be able to book a last minute cruise for half the original price. For example, two backpackers I went diving with told me about how an eight-day cruise that was originally almost $3000 cost them a mere $1,200. And, that's only because they chose first class. You can also try booking a last minute cruise from Quito or Guayquil before you go, although Puerto Ayora is where you'll find the best deals. Note: If traveling during high season, you may not get the exact dates you want. Skip The Cruise Altogether. While a cruise of the Galapagos Islands is a great experience, some people are operating on a budget, or may just want to spend more time on land. For me, there were certain things I wanted to do, like diving, swimming with sharks and sea lions, laying on white sand beaches, hiking and seeing giant tortoises. I was able to do all these things without the help of a cruise. For instance, many of the hikes and beaches were free and didn't require a guide. Furthermore, diving with sharks and sea lions was $120, or $50 if you wanted to snorkel.

In the past, if Antarctica was on a travel bucket list it was probably in the same category as \"Walk on the Moon\" or \"Travel back in time.\" In other words, it probably was not going to happen. Recently, Antarctica has gained new popularity as a viable travel bucket list addition as more travelers visit and live to tell about it �C some on television.

				array("title" => "Tips For Backpacking South America.","description" =>"Backpacking South America is a worthwhile adventure I recommend everyone to have at least once in their lives. Before I arrived on the continent, I was unsure of what to expect. To help prepare you before you go, here are some things I wish I had known before I left for my trip. Know the Exchange Rate. The exchange rates vary considerably from country to country in South America. For example, while travelers can spend a lot of time in Bolivia and Peru, stretching their dollar very far, popular tourist cities in Brazil, Chile and the Galapagos Islands can be expensive. If you're on a budget, look up which cities are the most affordable beforehand. For example, I noticed in Argentina that the farther south I went �C basically the farther into Patagonia �C the more expensive things cost. For example, my usual chicken sub went from being 10 to 15 Argentine Pesos ($2 to $3) in Buenos Aires to 45 to 60 Argentine Pesos ($10 to $14) in Bariloche. Moreover, don't always think \"roughing it\" will save you money. Making use of the shelters on the \"W\" circuit in Torres del Paine and camping your way through the Inca Trail to Macchu Pichu are quite expensive. In fact, one night in a \"refugio\" in Torres del Paine will cost about $40 to $60 �C and that only includes the mattress. Camping in the park is free if you bring your own gear; however, this can be tricky as the hike is difficult at times and you will have to carry your own equipment. Moreover, to trek with a good company for the Inca Trail will cost about $500 to $650 for the trek.","url" => "","source" => "yahoo.com"),

The park is regarded by many as the \"trekking capital of the world.\" After visiting for myself, it was easy to see why. While many travelers choose to spend three or four days hiking the \"W\" circuit, this is not feasible for everyone. Some people may not have the time, while others might not feel up to the intensity of the hike or the planning. Furthermore, Torres del Paine tends to be extremely windy, and if you add rain to the equation, long-term hiking can be unpleasant. For me, the problem was a mixture of all these things. I knew if I tried to do a day hike I wouldn't see a lot. Additionally, the forecasted rain did not make me excited to be outside. On the other hand, I wanted to experience the park and hike at least a bit of it. The solution? A 4x4 tour with Patagonia Extrema Viajes. I was able to book the tour at Chalt��n Travel in El Calafate, Argentina. The experience allowed for three hours in the park driving to different sites, some of which included Salto Grande Waterfall, Bitter Lake, the Rio Paine, Paine Grande and, of course, the Horns of Paine. There was also a one-hour hike to help visitors get even closer to nature.","url" => "","source" => "yahoo.com"),

I was informed the best place to do this was in a town called El Chalt��n. Nicknamed the \"trekking capital of Argentina,\" a traveler could spend days hiking around the beautiful mountains, forests and rivers of the area. Lucky for me, day trips are possible from El Calafate for 180 Argentine Pesos (about $41) round trip. The bus leaves from El Calafate at 8:00 a.m., and picks you up from El Chalt��n at 6:30 p.m. Each way takes about three hours. While I highly recommend spending a few days in El Chalt��n to explore Los Glaciares Nacional Park and Mount Fitz Roy, it is possible to see a lot in just a few hours. In the gallery below, you can see my trek, which took me about four hours total. To access the Fitz Roy trailhead, cross town from the bus station via San Martin Avenue. Walk until the road ends and you'll see a sign that says \"Sendero al Fitz Roy.\" Enter here, veering to the left, and follow the trail for Laguna Capri. You'll be able to complete a moderately intense circuit with unbelievable views that will make you feel like you're in a real-life Bob Ross masterpiece. From Laguna Capri, walk to Poincenot for excellent views of Mount Fitz Roy.

				array("title" => "How to sell a campervan in New Zealand.","description" =>"As I hope I've exhibited in penning the series \"Freedom to Roam,\" there are few better travel experiences than touring New Zealand by campervan. Trekking through the Southern Alps, exploring hidden wine regions, sampling freshly caught seafood, basking on lazy beaches -- all are accessible by simply putting four wheels beneath your feet and hitting the open road. That being said, all of that goes out the window once it comes time to sell the van. For all the monuments of relaxation, which lay scattered about the country, selling a van in New Zealand can be the most ulcer-inducing, stress-provoking, miserable existence that can surely be the worst part of your trip. It's the price to pay for the economic gamble, and unlike most fairy tales, it doesn't always have a happy ending. As I discussed in the initial entry to the series, \"New Zealand by campervan,\" travelers can save heaps of money on long-term New Zealand travel by opting to buy and sell a van versus renting one and eating the cost. Potential risks of this option, however, involve buying a van that needs immediate maintenance or, worse yet, the chance that you aren't able to sell the van before you leave the country.","url" => "","source" => "yahoo.com"),

According to the website, you'll also be able to safely avoid flooding, earthquakes and sandstorms. Best of all, you get the unique experience of hanging from a tree like a spider monkey. Can you get any closer to nature than that? To set it up, the tentsile should be attached to three trees. I'm not quite sure how you get it up there, but hopefully you've been practicing those spider monkey skills. Once it is successfully constructed you can expect a restful sleep.

Another option is to take a Regional Express (REX) airline to Merimbula, which is also on the Sapphire Coast and only about 10-15 minutes away. Where to stay. While there are a few hotel options in Pambula, my recommendation is to check out the Holiday Hub Beach Resort. What's great about this accommodation is that it has something to offer every kind of traveler. For people who are looking for luxury and comfort, the resort offers villas, apartments, and cabins with full linens, televisions, and kitchens, as well as an on-site spa and heated pool. When I stayed here I chose the more rustic option of camping out right next to the beach in a tent. At night, my friends and I would roast marshmallows over a camp fire, play games, and stargaze while in the morning the salty sea air and scratching of kangaroos trying to get into our food would give us a unique wake up.
